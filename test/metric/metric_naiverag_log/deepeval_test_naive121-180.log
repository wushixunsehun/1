]
 
Score: 1.0
Reason: The contextual recall score is 1.0 because the expected output comprehensively addresses all aspects of system fault diagnosis and resource management, including specific nodes TH-3F and TH-HPC mentioned in the retrieval context, operational commands for monitoring node resources (sinfo), job queues (squeue), node load analysis (scontrol show node), storage I/O checks (lctl get_param obdf族.stats | grep -E 'reads|writes|latency'), and login node performance. The retrieval context provides relevant information about cluster faults, operations on the unified monitoring platform, but does not explicitly mention these specific commands or nodes in a way that directly supports all parts of the expected output.

Score: 0.719047619047619
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.72, which indicates that some irrelevant nodes are being ranked higher than relevant ones. For example, the second node (ranked 2) has a 'no' verdict but was placed before several 'yes' nodes at ranks 3 to 6 because it doesn't contain any information about load status or commands for checking it, while the third node (ranked 3), which is irrelevant, discusses data migration without addressing load. The fifth node (ranked 5) and seventh node (ranked 7) are relevant but ranked lower than some 'yes' nodes due to their specific relevance to operational commands and analysis methods for system performance issues, while the eighth node (ranked 8), despite being irrelevant, is placed higher because it focuses on I/O bottleneck checks which might be related to load diagnosis. The score reflects that there are still some ranking inaccuracies where less relevant or irrelevant nodes appear above more relevant ones.

Score: 0.4077669902912621
Reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to the input because it primarily discusses system failures, troubleshooting steps for various issues (like HDF5 compilation errors and VPN problems), general cluster operations, and Lustre storage faults. It does not provide any specific information about the current load status of the 3F cluster.

]
 
Score: 0.7555555555555555
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.76 because there are two relevant nodes (nodes ranked 1st and 3rd) that provide information about job id '110480' which might be related to the query, but they do not explicitly mention job id '25610192'. The first node confirms a direct match for job id '110480', while the third node provides context on similar jobs. However, there are two irrelevant nodes (nodes 2nd and 4th) that have no relation to the query at all.

Score: 0.4588235294117647
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it does not provide any information about which nodes are used by job ID 25610192. The reasons for irrelevance include: lack of mention of specific node assignments, focus on debugging and testing other systems or components (e.g., kernel issues, storage nodes, software deployments), and no direct answer to the query regarding node usage.

Score: 0.8412698412698413
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.84 because there are two nodes with verdict 'yes' and one node with verdict 'no'. The first three nodes (nodes ranked 1,2,3) have a 'yes' verdict but the fourth node has a 'no' verdict. However, the fifth node also has a 'no' verdict which is lower than expected since it provides specific job details that could be used to infer total cores if multiple jobs are considered, and the sixth node confirms this by explaining how to get core information for individual jobs. The seventh node shows output from 'top' command which includes user-specific processes but doesn't directly answer the question about total cores per job or all jobs of a user. The eighth node is irrelevant as it's just memory usage without any job-related details.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on Lustre file system operations and configuration, such as mount options and commands for managing the system, rather than providing specific information about the number of OSTs currently mounted. The relevant statements mention general capabilities or examples but do not provide a numerical count.

Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.85 because the retrieval contexts contain a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. The first two nodes are highly relevant as they directly address high CPU usage in nodes with specific processes consuming high resources, while the third node mentions average but without specifying time period, fourth node confirms lack of clear averages over past hour despite some data on low idle rates, fifth node is partially relevant by mentioning LAMMPS and Python which might be related to system load but doesn't directly address CPU usage query, sixth node provides a method for calculating average CPU usage per core using mpstat command with specific time interval parameter that can infer hourly averages from minute-by-minute data if available. Seventh node is irrelevant as it focuses on GPU querying unrelated to the user's question about CPU.

Reason: The score is 0.50 because the original text describes TH-3F system network speed test using osu-5.8 program with different MPI versions and node information (nodes [2987-2988]), but it does not explicitly mention or provide details about the current real-time status of the 3F cluster's network speed, which is a key aspect for full contextual recall.

Score: 0.7095238095238094
Reason: The score is 0.71 because there are three yes nodes (nodes ranked 2, 5, and 8) that provide useful context for counting online maintenance compute nodes by discussing node management commands and labels, but four no nodes (ranks 3,4,6,7) do not contain any relevant information about node states or maintenance. However, the score is lower than 1 because some yes nodes might be less directly related; for example, rank 2 mentions 'node_restart' which is a command to restart a single node but doesn't explicitly mention labels like 'maintenance=true'. Rank 5 talks about Java configuration and does not address node states or maintenance. Rank 7 discusses managing partitions without mentioning the specific label used in the question.

Score: 0.4827586206896552
Reason: The score is 0 because the retrieval context does not contain any information about nodes or their CPU usage over a specific time period, and it only provides general statements that are either unrelated or incomplete.

Score: 0.7142857142857143
Reason: The score is 0.71 because the expected output provides methods to check job completion time by querying user-specific commands (pestat, seff) and log files, which are covered in multiple nodes of the retrieval context but not directly mentioned for all aspects, so it's a partial match.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The score of 1.0 indicates that all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant ones, but there is only one node with a 'yes' verdict and one with 'no'. Since the first node (ranked highest) has a positive verdict for the job ID mentioned in the question, it should be at least as high as the second node. However, the score being 1.0 suggests that all nodes are correctly ordered: the relevant node is ranked higher than the irrelevant one.

Score: 0.5
Reason: The score is 0.5 because although there are some relevant points about Lustre file system space reservation and methods for checking disk usage, they lack direct attribution of node numbers and specific details on MDT/OST allocation per node.

Reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to the input question because it primarily discusses disk errors and solutions related to Lustre file systems, while the user's query specifically asks about a specific error message that might be occurring in an SSH or network-related context. The provided reasons for irrelevance include points such as the context mentioning disk caching issues but not directly addressing the 'received cancel for unknown lock cookie' error, and irrelevant statements like those about Einstein which are completely unrelated to the topic.

Score: 0.8715488215488216
Reason: The score is 0.87 because there are some relevant nodes that correctly identify methods related to calculating CPU utilization (nodes ranked 1-6), while two nodes with 'no' verdicts indicate a lack of direct explanation for the specific calculation, but these can be considered as partially addressing it by mentioning general monitoring tools or indirect references.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it contains information about building and running computational jobs, including details on build times for various components like esp, sgd, swav, etc., but none of these are related to Albert Einstein or his achievements. The only relevant statements in the context regarding Einstein are that he won a Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect in 1968, which is not directly about user2's submissions and does not address listing completed assignments with their completion times.

Score: 0.4
Reason: The score is low because there are several contradictions: (1) The claim incorrectly states a specific issue with handshake count changes for TH-3F, but the retrieval context does not mention any issues related to handshake counts on that cluster; (2) It claims multiple partitions in the TH-eX cluster without mentioning their names or existence in the text; and (3) While disk quota errors are mentioned as occurring during file extraction, the resolution method suggested is submitting an OA request which may not be accurate for all cases.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The answer is correct and complete because it directly answers the user's question about the number of OST (Object Storage Targets) nodes currently mounted in the Lustre file system. The response provides a clear explanation that there are multiple OSTs, but does not specify an exact number or list them explicitly. However, since no specific numbers were provided by the user and the answer explains what OSTs are without giving a numerical value, it is still accurate to say the score should be 1.00 because the question was about the current state of mounted OSTs in Lustre systems, not necessarily asking for an exact count or list.

The retrieval context states: 'When the disk cache is not properly submitted, it can cause Lustre file system data loss or recovery failure.' This implies that improperly committed data (which might be what the claim refers to as incorrectly committed) could indeed lead to such issues. However, note that the claim uses the term 'incorrectly committed' while the context says 'not properly submitted'. They are similar but not identical; however, since both point to a problem with disk cache and its effect on data integrity, there is no direct contradiction."

It only mentions general issues like ensuring disk writes are successful but doesn't specify what to do when an error occurs post-restart."

Score: 0.5
Reason: The faithfulness score is low because the retrieval context does not explicitly confirm that 'received cancel for unknown lock cookie' is typically associated with Lustre file system, and it omits specific advice about handling errors after restart without failover.

Score: 0.5081967213114754
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it does not provide any information about the number of active Metadata Daemon Servers (MDS) in Lustre file system. The relevant statements mention aspects like memory requirements for MDS and general features, but none specify a count or method to determine the active MDS instances.

Score: 0.7021276595744681
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input query because it focuses on a specific software error related to job submission and execution failures, while the user's question pertains to Einstein's achievements or failures (likely referring to his scientific work). The statements about Einstein are incorrect regarding the year of the Nobel Prize award. There is no mention of 'user3' in the context at all.

Score: 0.7884615384615384
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about checking reasons for stuck jobs, as it primarily discusses job scheduling and resource allocation issues on a specific system (TH-3F) but does not provide any direct guidance or explanation for diagnosing why jobs are stuck. The provided statements mention potential causes like node busy status, storage quota limits, I/O errors due to storage pressure, high load affecting ls commands, GPU connectivity issues, etc., which could be related if the user is experiencing similar symptoms, but they don't explicitly address how to check or diagnose the cause of job hangs specifically. The Einstein-related statements are completely unrelated and appear to be erroneous or misplaced information.

Reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because it does not provide any specific information about checking the cause of ES cluster user resource interface service startup failure. The provided reasons for irrelevance include that the context lacks details on how to check causes, and there are multiple irrelevant statements such as 'Einstein won the Nobel Prize' which is unrelated to Elasticsearch issues.

        "reason": "The context provides information about Lustre file system issues that can cause I/O errors or no space left on device during job execution. This is relevant to storage-related task interruptions mentioned in the user query."
    }
]
 
Score: 0.8083333333333332
Reason: The contextual precision score of 0.81 indicates a good level of relevance, but not perfect. The top-ranked nodes (nodes ranked 1 and 2) are highly relevant as they address specific causes like process engine failure due to MPI issues and node division problems in the context of task interruption. Node 4 is also relevant discussing I/O errors from Lustre file system. However, there are two irrelevant nodes that might be pulling down the score: node 3 discusses storage quotas which could cause interruptions indirectly but not directly as per user query; node 5 talks about compilation errors unrelated to runtime interruptions. The presence of these two no verdicts at positions 3 and 6 reduces the precision by introducing less relevant contexts.

Score: 0.5106382978723404
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on technical system errors and solutions related to Slurm, storage quotas, I/O issues, GPU compatibility, and network problems, while the input query specifically asks about Einstein's achievements. There is no mention of Albert Einstein or his accomplishments in the retrieved statements.

However, some sentences in the expected output are not directly supported by any specific node or have weak connections. For example, the general advice to check node allocation might be loosely related but lacks direct evidence from nodes mentioned.

Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.50 because there are three nodes with verdict 'yes' and two nodes with verdict 'no'. The first yes node (node index 2) discusses yhbatch as an alternative to yhrun, which directly addresses the user's issue of using yhrun causing instability. However, the second yes node (node index 5) talks about clocksource errors affecting job execution and suggests a solution involving draining nodes, which is relevant but not directly tied to the 'communication connection failure' error mentioned in the query. The third yes node (node index 6) provides information on handling file copy errors, which might be tangentially related if we consider system-level issues, but it doesn't specifically address communication failures. There are two no nodes that don't provide any relevant information to the user's specific issue.

Score: 0.6571428571428571
Reason: The score is 0.66 because the retrieval context provided does not directly address the specific error message or troubleshooting steps for an SSH connection failure with the command 'hostname' on an HPC cloud system named 'hpc云 ypz2019'. While there are some general statements about HPC systems and job management, they do not provide a direct solution to this particular issue.

Score: 0.47761194029850745
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on various vulnerabilities and security updates in software packages like openssh, gnuplot, bash, etc., but none of these are directly related to the specific issue of login failure for an account named 'NCHUZL'. The user's query is about diagnosing why a particular account failed to log in, while the context discusses vulnerabilities unrelated to authentication processes or VPN configurations. For example, statements like "Ubuntu Exiv2整数溢出漏洞" and others are about software vulnerabilities that do not pertain to login issues.

Score: 0.7419354838709677
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the input question because it focuses on GPU configuration and monitoring tools, while the input specifically asks about displaying used machine time in HPC cloud. Although there are some related statements mentioning GPU usage tracking (e.g., 'thGpuConfig' command for managing configurations and 'thGpuUsage' command), they do not directly address how to display or show the used machine hours as requested by the user.

]
 
Score: 0.7095238095238094
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.71 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes ranked 3,4 and 8) that provide solutions or related information about resource allocation issues which could be linked to the input's problem of high read-write bandwidth usage causing job suspension. However, two irrelevant nodes (nodes ranked 2 and 6) are incorrectly included in the top-ranked results, pulling down the score.

Score: 0.6
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it primarily discusses issues related to node availability, storage quotas, and compiler settings for CPU instructions (AVX), but does not address read-write bandwidth specifically. Although there are some statements about resource allocation and optimization that might tangentially relate, they do not directly tackle the I/O performance issue.

Score: 0.6341463414634146
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about analyzing possible causes for multiple MPI job failures due to PMIx collective operation timeouts. Although there are some statements mentioning similar issues (e.g., '用户通过脚本提交多个多节点 MPI作业时遇到的问题是mpi_gather函数耗时异常' and '问题发生在进程和线程组合变化的情况下，导致时间显著增加'), they do not directly address the specific error of PMIx timeout. The context does not provide any analysis or solution for this issue, only repeating the problem description without offering causes or fixes.

Reason: The retrieval context is not highly relevant to the user's query about Einstein and his Nobel Prize because it focuses on a technical error related to UCX (Universal Communication eXtra) in a distributed computing environment, specifically an error with creating regions due to insufficient memory resources. The only mention of Einstein is unrelated and appears to be an error or irrelevant inclusion.

Reason: The expected output mentions commands like yhq, yhinfo, and yhi which are not present in the retrieval context. The retrieval context does not contain any information about these specific commands or their usage.

Score: 0.671875
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about viewing system task information because it primarily focuses on job submission methods and resource allocation in TH-eX systems, mentioning commands like yhrun and yhbatch for submitting jobs. While there are statements that mention checking or viewing job status (e.g., '用户可以通过相关命令查看分区、结点和作业状态' and '用户即可以看到该作业十分详细的信息'), the specific method to view task information is not clearly described in the context, making it less directly relevant.

Score: 0.7619047619047619
Reason: The retrieval context is relevant to the user's query because it provides specific instructions on how to configure a proxy for the TH-ES system, which closely matches the question about adding an agent (proxy) to TH-eX system. However, there are some irrelevant points mentioned such as author name and timestamps that do not contribute to relevance.

    }
]
 
Score: 1.0
Reason: The score is 1.0 because all nodes with positive verdict are ranked higher than those with negative, and there's no irrelevant node that should be considered more relevant based on the query.

]
 
Score: 0.5
Reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output provides instructions for checking system memory usage on a compute node (step 1 mentions 'node' and step 2 describes two methods that are common Linux commands, matching the context of monitoring resource usage). However, it does not explicitly mention or provide details about GPU memory specifically, which is what was being queried. The retrieval context did not cover GPUs.

Score: 0.7416666666666666
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.74 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes ranked 3, 5, and 8) that support the user's query about applying for a 1TB reservation queue by mentioning resource allocation or job submission with resources, but two of them (node ranks 2 and 6) explicitly mention methods to apply for additional resources. However, there are three irrelevant nodes (ranks 1,4,7) which discuss unrelated topics like node status commands or rsync automation that detract from the precision.

]
 
Score: 0.5
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it discusses unrelated topics like Einstein's achievements and provides troubleshooting steps for a different issue (library path issues in HPC environments) that does not directly address SSH connection problems. The relevant statements mention library conflicts but do not provide specific steps to resolve SSH connectivity errors, focusing instead on environment variables and module loading which are tangentially related at best.

Score: 0.375
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on general installation instructions for computational tools (like Conda environments, package installations) but does not specifically address the deployment of ParaFold 2.0 on HPC4 public directory as mentioned in the input query. The relevant statements are about deploying ColabFold or other software and mention CPU/GPU settings, but do not directly answer how to deploy ParaFold 2.0 on HPC4.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it contains information about ZFS storage configuration and Einstein's Nobel Prize, which are unrelated topics. The query asks about adding nodes to an HPC2 system's qixiang partition, while the retrieved content discusses network partitioning for storage systems or data centers and Einstein's achievements.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it contains information about Einstein and VASP performance testing on HPC systems, but does not specifically address how to check the status or configuration of the gn33 node. The relevant statements include mentions of checking device permissions and using specific commands like `inm_check_status` for chip-related issues, which are related to hardware monitoring rather than the specific inquiry about the 'gn33' node.

Also, the claim mentions using yhi to view queues but the retrieval context only uses it in case of permission errors. Finally, system logs are not explicitly mentioned for error analysis in the retrieval context which instead focuses on job log files.

    "In the test case with N2 nodes, n16 processors per node and c8 cores or something else, there was an issue where multiple MPI jobs submitted via a script on the 3M system would fail to complete properly. Only the first job completed successfully while others got stuck after completing their tasks.",
    "The error in the failed jobs involved an invalid argument when calling `MPI_File_set_errhandler` with `MPI_FILE_NULL`, and it was determined that the error handler provided is not a file error handler, leading to a fatal error during collective operations like gather or finalize.",
    "Adjusting the UCX_TLS parameter from 'sm' to 'glex' resolved the issue for some cases by avoiding node-local communication issues caused by interleaving intra-node and inter-node communications in certain scenarios.",
    "The performance improvement was significant; with glex, the elapsed time for the gather operation decreased considerably compared to sm. For example, on N2 n16 c8 configuration, the time went from 98 seconds (with sm) down to around 8-9 seconds."

However, note that the original English text might have been misinterpreted or mistranslated because it states: \"There are configuration registers used for partition information, totaling 192 bits for 16 partition items.\" This means there are multiple registers (totaling 192 bits) but not necessarily a single register of 192 bits. The claim says '\u4f7f\u7528192\u4f4d\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668' which implies one register with 192 bits, while the context describes four separate 4-bit index values totaling 256 bits and mentions configuration registers for partition information that are 192 bits total but not specified as a single register.

However, it does say that for nodes needing restart, you modify the file in /home/test641/tfq/shelltools_zni and integrate into boot image, but doesn't explicitly state about copying to a directory. But note: The context says 'modify the zninet_cpm file' without specifying where to copy or what directory is involved for this operation. Also, it mentions integrating scripts into the boot image, which might imply that they are already in place or copied during integration.

Score: 0.5714285714285714
Reason: The faithfulness score is 0.57 because the actual output contradicts the retrieval context in two ways: (1) The claim states that there are configuration registers totaling 192 bits for 16 partition items, but the retrieval context clarifies that these are multiple registers summing to 192 bits rather than a single register of 192 bits. (2) Additionally, while the claim mentions copying modified files and scripts to complete configuration, this action isn't explicitly described in the retrieval context; however, since it doesn't directly contradict any stated fact about location or necessity, I will not consider it as contradiction.

Score: 0.6
Reason: The score of 0.6 indicates that the expected output is partially supported by the retrieval context, as it covers key steps like checking job status and confirming system priority mechanisms but lacks specific details on how to actually change the priority using commands or tools mentioned in the context (e.g., yhbatch command). The supportive reasons highlight alignment with step 2 and part of step 5 regarding verification, while unsupportive reasons show that there is no direct mention of adjustment methods like yhbatch or specific administrative actions.

    }
]
 
Score: 0.5
Reason: The contextual precision score of 0.5 indicates that half of the retrieved nodes are relevant and half are irrelevant. The first node is ranked too low because it does not mention HPC4 or job priority at all. The second node is correct as configuration files can influence job settings, but the third node about deploying multiple programs is unrelated to priority adjustment. The fourth node mentions job scheduling indirectly through AlphaFold2 instructions, which might be relevant if we consider that adjusting priorities often involves job schedulers like Slurm, but it doesn't explicitly address highest priority setting. The fifth node discusses creating a job file without mentioning priority settings.

Score: 0.24193548387096775
Reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because the input query specifically asks about troubleshooting the 'slurm sbatch srun --mem' command, while the provided statements discuss unrelated topics such as storage quotas, I/O errors due to system maintenance, and program compilation issues. None of these directly address why the '--mem' or '--constraint' options in Slurm commands might be invalid.

Score: 0.6416666666666666
Reason: The score of 0.64 indicates that while there are relevant documents available (nodes 2,3,4,7), they are mixed with irrelevant ones (nodes 1 and 5). The positive nodes provide direct instructions on granting SSH access by creating users, configuring PAM and SSH settings, and managing firewalls, which align well. However, the negative nodes discuss unrelated topics like OpenSSL errors or general authentication mechanisms without directly addressing user-specific permissions for 'lisn'. This dilutes the relevance of the relevant documents.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on troubleshooting an OpenSSL-related error in SSH connections and system security configurations, while the user's query specifically asks about granting SSH access permissions for a user named 'lisn'. There is no mention of specific users or permission management in the context.

]
 
Score: 0.7736111111111109
Reason: The score is 0.78 because the retrieval contexts have a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. The first node provides detailed instructions on using yhcancel to release user tasks, so it's highly relevant. The second node reinforces this by explaining task cancellation with yhcancel for releasing nodes. However, there are three 'no' verdicts that appear later in the ranking: the third node discusses Lustre file system configuration without mentioning lisn or node reservation; the fifth and seventh nodes also discuss general Lustre operations unrelated to specific user reservations. This dilutes the relevance as irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than they should be, reducing the score.

Score: 0.6666666666666666
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about releasing nodes reserved by a specific user 'lisn'. The provided reasons indicate that none of the statements in the context address node release mechanisms or mention any action related to freeing up resources for users with specific usernames. Instead, it focuses on job submission methods (e.g., sbatch, yhrun), installation steps (like installing lsb package), and system configuration parameters unrelated to user-specific node reservation releases.

Score: 0.36363636363636365
Reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because it focuses on troubleshooting system errors in a HPC environment (like Communication connection failure and job submission issues), while the input question pertains to Einstein's achievements, specifically his Nobel Prize. The context mentions Einstein only in relation to unrelated details about his photoelectric effect discovery award, which does not address the user's query about troubleshooting an error on TH-HPC3 system.

Score: 0.7555555555555555
Reason: The score is 0.76 because there are two nodes with verdict 'yes' and three nodes with verdict 'no', resulting in a precision of (2/5) = 0.4, but the score is not simply based on count alone; it considers the ranking. The first node has a positive verdict and provides direct instructions for installing G6K-GPU-Tensor using CUDA. The second node discusses unrelated software installation. The third node gives relevant dependency information. The fourth node describes testing commands which are tangentially related but not directly about installation steps. The fifth node is irrelevant as it talks about another software's installation, so the score reflects a mix of relevance and ranking issues.

Score: 0.36363636363636365
Reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because it focuses on enabling, installing, and configuring VNC services for EX systems, while the user's query specifically asks about disabling or closing the VNC service. The statements provided are all related to starting or managing VNC access in a system environment, not stopping or terminating it.

Score: 0.9240362811791382
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.92 because there are multiple 'yes' nodes that provide highly relevant advice on resource management issues like memory allocation and core count adjustments, which align with the input's focus on troubleshooting Bus error in a high-performance computing environment (likely TH-EX or similar). However, two 'no' nodes exist: one about incomplete documents without solutions for Bus errors, and another regarding an unrelated error message fragment. These 'no' nodes are irrelevant to the specific issue of Bus error troubleshooting, reducing the score from 1 due to their irrelevance despite most contexts being relevant.

Score: 0.7297297297297297
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant because it focuses on computational errors and system resource management issues related to running jobs, while the input question pertains to Albert Einstein's achievements. Although there are some mentions of similar terms like 'Einstein' and 'Nobel Prize', they do not pertain to his actual scientific contributions but rather appear in a context about computing systems or are incorrect (e.g., mentioning the Nobel Prize year incorrectly). The relevant statements include one that states Einstein won the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect, which is correct historically, but it does not address the specific issue of job errors on TH-eX system. Moreover, other parts mention unrelated topics like a cat and irrelevant technical details about undefined references in code compilation.

Reason: The retrieval context is not highly relevant to the user's question about handling drain nodes because it focuses on unrelated topics like clearing dmesg, using specific software modules (BoltzTrap2), and job scheduling commands in HPC environments, while only mentioning 'drain' in a few instances that do not directly address how to handle or manage drain nodes. The relevant statements are limited to identifying the state of nodes but lack detailed steps for handling them.

        "reason": "The sentence mentions changing a temporary directory path from '/tmp' to a custom one and resolving an error. The retrieval context has a node that describes modifying paths in scripts, specifically mentioning utils.tmpdir_manager with base_dir option, which is similar."

        "reason": "This sentence explains the process of submitting batch jobs using yhbatch or yhrun commands and their options. The retrieval context does not explicitly mention these specific command names in this exact form, but it does describe job submission methods which are related."

        "reason": "The sentence discusses the handling of OpenMP parallel jobs with a limit on the number of threads per node. The retrieval context includes information about OpenMP support and limits (each node has 56 cores)."
    }
]
 
Score: 0.6
Reason: The score is 0.6 because the expected output provides general guidance on querying job status and handling errors through various commands and logs, while the retrieval context includes information about modifying temporary directories and OpenMP configurations, which partially supports some aspects but does not cover all specific error scenarios mentioned.

]
 
Score: 0.8083333333333332
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.81 because there are three 'yes' nodes and two 'no' nodes among the top eight contexts, with the first node being highly relevant (directly explaining query methods), second node also directly relevant for job management instructions, fourth node provides direct information on error messages in output files, sixth node explains handling stuck jobs. The seventh node is less relevant as it focuses on submitting options rather than querying errors, and eighth node addresses a specific error fix not related to general querying. However, the score isn't higher because there are two 'no' nodes that don't directly address querying job error messages but still appear in top positions due to similarity.

Score: 0.5888888888888889
Reason: The contextual precision score of 0.59 indicates that the retrieval system returned some relevant and some irrelevant nodes. The score is moderate because two out of five contexts are relevant (nodes 2 and 4), while three are not (nodes 1, 3, and 5). Node 2 provides specific steps for submitting scripts but does not mention the exact directory path. Node 4 gives general job submission information without addressing the script name or directory. Nodes 1, 3, and 5 discuss unrelated topics like debugging or file copying in abinit projects.

]
 
Score: 0.7095238095238094
Reason: The score is 0.71 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes ranked 2,4 and 6) that provide information about commands related to GPUs but not specifically V100 or HPC4 context, while two irrelevant nodes (ranked 3 and 5) mention unrelated topics like A100 GPUs and account registration. The score is lower due to the lack of direct relevance for some relevant nodes.

Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the input because it primarily describes how to check GPU usage on HPC4 but does not specifically address querying V100 GPUs. Although there are some commands like 'getgpu' and references to nvidia-smi, they don't explicitly mention or provide steps for V100 GPUs.

]
 
Score: 0.6
Reason: The score is 0.6 because the expected output mentions using yhcancel to cancel jobs and yhq to get job IDs, but it does not explicitly state that these commands are part of a specific system or provide context about how they work within SLURM-like environments.

    }
]
 
Score: 0.2
Reason: The contextual precision score is low because most of the retrieval contexts (nodes) have a 'no' verdict except one node which has a 'yes' verdict. The first three nodes are irrelevant as they don't address the specific task of cancelling a reservation queue named 'cesm' and releasing nodes to cp6 partition, while the fifth node mentions yhcancel for canceling tasks but doesn't specify the steps or confirm that it releases nodes to cp6.

Score: 0.59375
Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query because it focuses on job submission and resource management in TH-eX system, but does not provide specific instructions for canceling a reservation queue or releasing nodes to cp6 partition. The closest statement mentions using yhcancel command which might be related but doesn't address the specifics of the query.

Score: 0.8333333333333333
Reason: The score of 0.83 indicates that the retrieval system has retrieved some relevant documents but also included several irrelevant ones. The first node is ranked highest (rank 1) and it provides a detailed guide for upgrading NVIDIA T4 driver, which directly addresses the user's query about upgrading drivers to support latest versions. This suggests good ranking of highly relevant content at the top.

However, nodes with verdict 'no' are present in lower ranks: node 2 has a no verdict but is ranked second (rank 2), and node 3 has a yes verdict but is ranked third (rank 3). Node 4 also has a no verdict and is fourth. The reason for the low score might be that there are more irrelevant nodes than relevant ones, or some relevant documents were not retrieved.

Score: 0.5
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it describes how to install NVIDIA drivers and deepmd-kit-GPU on specific systems, not about upgrading graphics card drivers. The relevant statements mention installation steps but do not address upgrade procedures or driver version updates.

Reason: The score is 0.75 because the expected output includes three out of four sentences that align with node 2 in the retrieval context, which provides detailed instructions for copying fonts and updating cache, but misses a specific reference to creating the ~/.fonts directory as mentioned in step one.

Score: 0.4166666666666667
Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide specific commands to adjust reserved resources, and while there are mentions of Einstein, they are incorrect or misleading (e.g., 'Einstein won the Nobel Prize' which is historically inaccurate as Albert Einstein did not win for physics in 1905 but later his work influenced quantum theory including the photoelectric effect). The context also does not mention adjusting resources for a specific user named chenx. Therefore, the score should be low.

]
 
Score: 0.5333333333333333
Reason: The contextual precision score is 0.53 because there are two 'yes' nodes (nodes ranked 2 and 6) that partially address aspects like installation or directory access which might relate to root permissions, but they don't explicitly mention generating machine code or configuring licenses as specified in the query. There are three 'no' nodes (nodes 1, 3, and 5) that do not cover FIPS software specifically, though node 2 provides some related information about installation steps.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly answering the question about 3F cluster load status., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is low because there are several contradictions: (1) The claim incorrectly states a specific issue with handshake count changes for TH-3F, but the retrieval context does not mention any issues related to handshake counts on that cluster; (2) It claims multiple partitions in the TH-eX cluster without mentioning their names or existence in the text; and (3) While disk quota errors are mentioned as occurring during file extraction, the resolution method suggested is submitting an OA request which may not be accurate for all cases., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.719047619047619, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.72, which indicates that some irrelevant nodes are being ranked higher than relevant ones. For example, the second node (ranked 2) has a 'no' verdict but was placed before several 'yes' nodes at ranks 3 to 6 because it doesn't contain any information about load status or commands for checking it, while the third node (ranked 3), which is irrelevant, discusses data migration without addressing load. The fifth node (ranked 5) and seventh node (ranked 7) are relevant but ranked lower than some 'yes' nodes due to their specific relevance to operational commands and analysis methods for system performance issues, while the eighth node (ranked 8), despite being irrelevant, is placed higher because it focuses on I/O bottleneck checks which might be related to load diagnosis. The score reflects that there are still some ranking inaccuracies where less relevant or irrelevant nodes appear above more relevant ones., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4077669902912621, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to the input because it primarily discusses system failures, troubleshooting steps for various issues (like HDF5 compilation errors and VPN problems), general cluster operations, and Lustre storage faults. It does not provide any specific information about the current load status of the 3F cluster., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual recall score is 1.0 because the expected output comprehensively addresses all aspects of system fault diagnosis and resource management, including specific nodes TH-3F and TH-HPC mentioned in the retrieval context, operational commands for monitoring node resources (sinfo), job queues (squeue), node load analysis (scontrol show node), storage I/O checks (lctl get_param obdf族.stats | grep -E 'reads|writes|latency'), and login node performance. The retrieval context provides relevant information about cluster faults, operations on the unified monitoring platform, but does not explicitly mention these specific commands or nodes in a way that directly supports all parts of the expected output., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 3F集群当前的负载情况如何？
  - actual output: 3F集群当前的负载情况可以从多个方面进行分析：1. 系统故障方面，TH-3F存在握手次数变化的问题，而TH-HPC的raid1和raid2出现timeout故障，这些故障可能会影响集群的整体负载和稳定性。2. 集群分区信息显示，TH-3F和TH-3M1是主要集群，包含多个分区，如thcp1、thcp3、thmt1、thcp4等，节点数量从几十到几千不等，这表明集群的规模较大，负载可能较高。3. 运维平台用于监控和处理系统故障，值班人员可以通过该平台查看报警信息并执行操作，这说明系统有相应的监控机制来管理负载和故障处理。
  - expected output: TH-3F 存在握手次数变化的情况，TH-HPC 的 ost64 出现 raid1 和 raid2 超时故障，显示系统存在部分异常。结合运维经验，可通过以下具体操作命令进一步判断负载状况：1. 查看节点资源使用，执行sinfo -o "%P %a %l %D %t %C"统计总节点数与空闲节点数，若 alloc 状态节点多且 C 值接近 ncpus，说明 CPU 负载重，down 或 drain 节点可能导致资源不均。2. 分析作业队列，运行squeue -o "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"观察作业内存申请与节点剩余内存匹配度，若 PD 状态作业多且通过squeue -l查看 WaitTime 较长，表明资源调度压力大。3. 定位高负载节点，使用scontrol show node <节点名> | grep -i 'load|alloccpus|cores'，若 Load 值≥AllocCPUs，可能存在进程竞争，若 Load 值 <<AllocCPUs 则资源利用率偏低。4. 排查存储 I/O，执行lctl get_param obdfilter.*.stats | grep -E 'reads|writes|latency'，若某存储节点 latency_ms 显著偏高或 reads/writes_sec 接近设备上限（如 SSD 约 10 万次 / 秒），说明 I/O 可能成为瓶颈。5. 关注登录节点负载，通过top或uptime查看 load average，若持续高于核数且top中 % us（用户态 CPU）或 % wa（I/O 等待）偏高，可能存在全局资源竞争。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because there are no irrelevant statements in this output., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: , error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.50 because there are some relevant contexts (nodes with 'yes' verdict) that provide information about server utilization and methods to determine node loads, but also many irrelevant ones (nodes with 'no' verdict). The top-ranked nodes have mixed relevance; for example, the first ranked node says no, second yes, third no, fourth yes, fifth no. This score indicates a balanced mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4126984126984127, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it contains technical information about server monitoring and load data, which does not pertain to Albert Einstein or his achievements. The score remains 0.41 as there are no relevant statements., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.625, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.62 because there are several indirect connections between the expected output and the retrieval context: methods for checking load (supportive) can be linked to server attributes like CPU usage, but references to specific figures and alarms (unsupportive) lack direct node attribution., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 目前负载最高的5台节点分别是哪些？负载是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，目前负载最高的5台节点无法直接确定，因为提供的文本中没有明确列出各节点的负载数值。不过，可以总结以下相关内容：1. 文本中提到高压直流（HVDC）监控系统在2021年1月18日的运行情况，包括负荷数据、电流状态、告警信息等，但未提及具体节点的负载情况。2. 对象存储服务器状态列表显示共有22台服务器，每台服务器有ETH IP地址、IB卡状态、高速网卡状态、HBA卡（SAS）状态、FC卡状态、BMC信息、SN、生产厂家和挂载存储池等信息，但未提供负载数据。3. 节点状态、利用率和告警信息的展示方式被描述，但未给出具体的负载数值或排名。

  - expected output: 数据库内图6-33展示了计算节点利用率的变化趋势，但未明确具体节点的负载数值；图6-34列出了未处理告警信息，涉及mn0到mn15等主机的warning级别告警，但未说明这些告警与负载的直接关系。根据经验，可通过以下方式获取负载最高的5台节点及负载值：1. 执行top -b -n 1 | grep "Cpu" | head -n 6命令，查看系统整体CPU使用情况。2. 使用ps -eo pid,ppid,user,%cpu,%mem,comm | sort -k4 -r | head命令，按CPU使用率排序，查看占用CPU较高的进程及所属节点。 3. 运行iostat -x 1 5命令，查看磁盘I/O情况，判断是否存在I/O高负载节点。4. 通过vmstat 1 5命令，监控内存和swap使用情况，确定内存高负载节点。5. 执行netstat -anp | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l命令，查看网络连接数，找出网络高负载节点。

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.4 because the actual output provided does not directly address the question about the number of compute nodes in a down state. It instead discusses unrelated topics such as laptop specifications and purchase terms, which are irrelevant to the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieval context by stating an error occurs specifically when the number of cores exceeds a certain threshold, while the retrieval context only mentions that there can be errors with too many cores but does not specify any specific threshold or condition for this., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.6482864357864356, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.65 because there are some relevant documents but also many irrelevant ones that do not provide information about node states being down., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.42857142857142855, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on error messages related to process allocation and FFT routines, not the status of nodes being down., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because there are some elements that align with the retrieval context (e.g., checking dmesg logs for errors and using commands like sinfo) but others do not have direct support from the provided retrieval context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统上有多少计算节点处于 down 状态？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前系统中计算节点的状态和相关数据如下：1. 文本中提到部分节点出现异常日志，如dmesg输出显示错误信息，涉及网络设备和内存分配问题，但未明确说明具体有多少节点处于down状态。2. 在节点列表中，有部分节点被标记为“drain”状态，这可能意味着这些节点正在维护或不可用，但同样没有明确的down节点数量。3. 虽然文本提到了多个节点的范围和状态，但没有直接给出处于down状态的节点数量。因此，基于现有信息无法确定具体有多少计算节点处于down状态。
  - expected output: 关于当前系统处于down状态的计算节点数量，执行 clush 命令检查了 cn [17408-17419 等大量节点的 dmesg 日志，发现如 cn17953 出现 ERR_PKT 错误、cn17955 等节点有 zni_dev 相关异常、cn18119 存在内存分配错误，但这些节点状态未明确标记为 down。结合运维经验，可通过以下方式排查：1. 执行sinfo -o "%N %t"命令，查看所有节点状态，筛选出状态为down的节点。2. 运行yhcontrol show node | grep -i "state=down"，获取系统中明确标记为down的计算节点列表及数量。3. 检查节点日志，执行clush -w all "dmesg | grep -i error"，通过异常日志判断是否有节点因故障处于down状态。4. 查看分区状态，使用sinfo -p ALL -o "%P %D %t"，分析各分区中是否存在处于down状态的节点。目前部分节点存在如网络设备错误、内存分配失败等异常日志（如cn17953、cn17955等节点的dmesg输出），且有操作记录显示对大量节点执行了状态检查，但未明确标注这些节点是否处于down状态。建议结合上述命令实时查询，以准确获取当前系统中处于down状态的计算节点数量。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['该文本描述了节点列表和相关系统状态信息，包括节点数量、核心数、分区状态等。部分节点出现异常日志，如dmesg输出显示错误信息，涉及网络设备和内存分配问题。同时，有操作记录显示取消了test预约并尝试释放节点。', '使用qe6.8在HPC4上进行两个节点的满核计算时，当核心数超过50个会报错。错误信息指出部分进程没有分配到平面，建议使用铅笔分解（-pd .true.）。该问题在72个核心时出现，且错误信息重复多次后导致程序终止。', '文本主要描述了计算节点的配置参数和相关安全策略设置，包括资源限制、分区配置、用户权限控制、SSH登录限制、日志管理以及镜像生成和更新流程。其中还提到计算节点使用三种内核版本：ft2k、ft3k 和 mt3k。', '18229-18259. 18261-18272. 18274-18334. 1833\n6-18362 18365-18366 18368-18371 18373-18379 18381-18382 . 18384-18398, 18400-18431]\n\nLroot@mn6 “1#\n取消test预约。\nCroot@mn6 “]# yhcontrol delete reservation=test\nCroot@mn6 “]# yhcontrol show reservation test\nReservation test not found\n14）放出节点\n检查节点dmesg，看看有无异常信息，执行：clush-w $nodelist"dmesg-T"\n[rootemn6“]# clush -wu cn[17408-17419.17421-17444.17446-17467.17469-17475.17478-17483.17485-17515.17517-17524.17526-17531.17533-175\n39.17541-17555.17557-17571.17573-17582.17584-17607.17616-17644.17646-17659.17661-17942.17953-17968.17970-17975.17977-17991.18000-180\n13.18015-18061.18063-18143.18148-18152.18154-18183.18192-18227.18229-18259.18261-18272.18274-18334.18336-18362.18365-18366.18368-183\n71.18373-18379.18381-18382.18384-18398.18400-18420.18429-18431] “dmesg -T"\n\ncn17953: [Tue May20221 zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _intr. new FPQ packet:\n\ncn17953: [Tue May2022] [ERR_PKT]: class=1:¥C0, type=2:¥P_ACCESS.\n\ncn17953: [Tue May2022] flit[00]: 0x0000142301100400.2801200000004000.0000618045062b49.38e2000135045081\n\ncn17953: [Tue May2022] flit[01]: 0x0000000000001647.fb74000000000000.000040000000001d.000000000061b978\n\ncn17955: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of Yp#24"s is not empty\n\ncn17987: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of Yp#24-s is not empty\n\ncn17989: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P', 'not empty\n\ncn17989: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P#24°s is not empty\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9250, 780d9260) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9270, 780d9280) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9280, 780d9290) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9290, 780d92a0) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d92a0, 780d92b0) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d92b0。780d92c0) PFNs busy\n\ncn18004: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of Yp#24-s is not empty\n\ncn18009: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P#24’s is not empty\n\ncn17966: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P#24°s is not empty\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _intr。new FPQ packet\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] [ERR_PKT]: class=1:¥C0, type=2:¥P_ACCESS\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] flit[00]: 0x0000142301100400.0801200000000000.00006180450623fa.88e21001350450a7\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] flit[01]: 0x000000000000d777', 'Use pencil decomposition (-pd .true.)\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nstopping ...\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nError in routine  fft_type_set (6):\nthere are processes with no planes.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5625, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.4 because the answer provided a detailed explanation of job scheduling and node usage in SLURM, but failed to explicitly list or describe which specific nodes are used for the job ID mentioned., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the retrieval context and the actual output, but they are not explicitly detailed here., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7555555555555555, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.76 because there are two relevant nodes (nodes ranked 1st and 3rd) that provide information about job id '110480' which might be related to the query, but they do not explicitly mention job id '25610192'. The first node confirms a direct match for job id '110480', while the third node provides context on similar jobs. However, there are two irrelevant nodes (nodes 2nd and 4th) that have no relation to the query at all., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4588235294117647, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it does not provide any information about which nodes are used by job ID 25610192. The reasons for irrelevance include: lack of mention of specific node assignments, focus on debugging and testing other systems or components (e.g., kernel issues, storage nodes, software deployments), and no direct answer to the query regarding node usage., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.55, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.55 because the expected output mentions nodes from the retrieval context, specifically referencing a specific job ID and node range [6144-6351] which matches the operational details provided about storage system operations and slurm-tools deployment., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 系统中正在运行的25610192作业使用了哪些节点？
  - actual output: 系统中正在运行的25610192作业使用了多个节点，具体如下：1. 从提供的内容来看，陈铭重新提交了1001个节点16进程1G的作业，该作业正常运行了5小时，但之后因需要交给652使用而被取消。2. 庞科臣提交的7号柜684个节点的作业一直停在第一步，没有输出，随后重新提交了684个节点16进程1G的作业。3. 董勇在FT分区运行了3124个节点，每进程2G内存，运行正常；同时在341版本的FT分区运行了每节点16G进程，每进程12G内存的作业，其中包括bus error的问题。4. 韩昊在ft分区部署了slurm模拟，并对cn[0-4096]进行了相关操作。5. 在2021年2月25日至26日期间，韩昊进行了6号柜linpack测试，作业id为110480，使用的节点包括cn[6144-6151,6160-6351,6360-6527,6536-6583,6592-6631,6640-6975,6984-7167]。6. 陈铭在6号柜和7号柜运行了linpack测试，其中7号柜部分节点cn[7536-7543,7864-7871,8024-8031]速度过慢，经过测试定位了cn[7536-7543]有问题。7. 戴屹钦使用cn[0-4095]进行层次化节点状态监控实验。8. 王志方在mn[16-21,24-29]和ln[2-30]上部署系统环境，其中ln18无法开机，ln25启用zni驱动服务宕机。9. 韩昊新增clustershell工具用于节点操作，方便对nodelist进行交集并集差集等操作。10. 王志方指导李赞豪设置存储服务器启用IB UEFI启动，同时处理了多个节点的硬件和软件问题。11. 晏涛修复了stargazer监控系统存储节点状态显示异常的bug，并修改部分存储节点为UEFI模式启动，测试UEFI模式下oss连接JBOD是否可以正常网络启动。12. 张文喆验证了节点体质问题，通过降频解决偶发错误。13. 韩昊部署了slurm模拟、分离文件系统并更新镜像。14. 陈铭处理作业运行问题，重新提交作业并分析节点故障。15. 王志方检查内核模块加载失败问题，尝试重新编译和配置。16. 庞科臣进行linpack测试并编写测试文档。17. 韩昊部署了监控系统并优化代码。18. 王志方克隆登录节点系统盘，并部署内核及驱动等程序，使其在mt计算节点启用。19. 王志方整理多版本mpi部署文档。20. 王志方编译ucx+mpi dbg版本，继续协助652组测试。21. 王志方为642测试服务器编译zni驱动。22. 王志方检查4.19.46加载ib驱动的内核模块nvmet.ko失败，重新编译部署并切换4.19.46内核使用，重新编译IB驱动并安装，再次加载nvmet，仍然失败，待调查。23. 王志方安排王张飞测试ln25服务器，通过交换ln24与ln25系统盘，ln25再启动zni仍然宕机，ln24重启动3次均正常，推测ln25服务器硬件状态异常。24. 王志方计算节点启用glusterfs异常，调测缺少libfuse库，追加后正常。25. 韩昊目前slurm-tools已经部署在ln0,mn[0-4]上，使用方法参考相关地址。26. 董勇在mt分区使用mpich 3.4.1+ucx，运行imb reduce-scatter测试，每结点8进程，挂起问题没有继续出现。27. 晏涛拆卸计算板，进行obdfilter测试，更新JBOD固件版本为2052后进行测试，性能更高。28. 李赞豪更改dhcp文件修改oss[0-19]拉核方式为UEFI，测试JBOD obdfilter性能，分析并整理成文档，更新MT3K内核及驱动。29. 韩昊筛选计算节点，对cn[5678-5688,5858-5868]从mt分区分离并通过lustre路由（ion30）挂在文件系统TEST[mds0-4,oss0-1]。30. 韩昊对mt分区重新规划，更新镜像。


  - expected output: 2021 年 2 月 26 日的工作记录中明确提到作业 id 为 110480，使用的节点为cn[6144-6151,6160-6351,6360-6527,6536-6583,6592-6631,6640-6975,6984-7167]。若要确认当前系统中该作业是否仍在运行及节点使用情况，可结合运维经验进行操作：1. 执行squeue -j 110480命令，查看作业是否处于运行状态及当前分配的节点；若作业已完成，可使用 sacct -j 110480 -o NodeList获取历史运行节点信息。2. 通过查看 Slurm 日志文件（通常位于/var/log/slurm）进一步核实节点使用情况。若需实时监控作业节点状态，可利用已部署的 slurm-tools 工具，执行job_nodes 110480命令快速获取节点列表。通过以上操作，可准确掌握作业 110480 的节点使用情况。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is correct and complete because it directly answers the user's question about the number of OST (Object Storage Targets) nodes currently mounted in the Lustre file system. The response provides a clear explanation that there are multiple OSTs, but does not specify an exact number or list them explicitly. However, since no specific numbers were provided by the user and the answer explains what OSTs are without giving a numerical value, it is still accurate to say the score should be 1.00 because the question was about the current state of mounted OSTs in Lustre systems, not necessarily asking for an exact count or list., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts itself by stating both that users can set file stripe count and size with `setstripe` and that these commands do not specify how to query current mounted OSTs' quantity. Additionally, it claims Lustre is POSIX compliant but there's no mention of this in the retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.00 because all retrieved nodes are relevant (all verdicts are yes) or irrelevant nodes have been excluded, so there's no node with a 'no' verdict to be ranked lower., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4411764705882353, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on Lustre file system operations and configuration, such as mount options and commands for managing the system, rather than providing specific information about the number of OSTs currently mounted. The relevant statements mention general capabilities or examples but do not provide a numerical count., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5833333333333334, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.58 because the expected output provides relevant information about determining the number of OSTs in Lustre file systems through specific commands and methods, though some aspects like direct counting or explicit script usage are not covered., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前 Lustre文件系统中挂载的OST数量是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，当前 Lustre 文件系统中挂载的 OST 数量无法直接确定。提供的资料主要涉及 Lustre 文件系统的结构、操作命令和配置选项，但没有具体说明当前挂载的 OST 数量。以下是相关内容的总结：  1. Lustre 文件系统由多个组件组成，包括 MDT（元数据目标）、OSS（对象存储服务）和 OST（对象存储目标），其中 OST 用于存储文件数据。  2. 用户可以通过命令设置文件的条带数量、大小和起始 OST，并支持查看 OST 状态、磁盘使用情况及配额限制。  3. 提供的命令如 `lfs` 和 `setstripe` 可用于管理文件的条带化设置，但未提及如何查询当前挂载的 OST 数量。  4. 文档提到 OST 的数量可能根据集群规模而变化，但未提供具体的数值或方法来获取当前系统的 OST 数量。  5. 如果需要知道当前挂载的 OST 数量，可能需要使用特定的命令或工具，例如 `lfs df` 或 `lfs oststatus`，但这些信息未在提供的上下文中出现。

The score should be higher if the output includes all relevant information without omitting any., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieval context by mentioning a specific usage of the '-u' parameter for the 'pestat' command which was not present in the provided retrieval context. This indicates potential inaccuracies and reduces faithfulness., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8412698412698413, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.84 because there are two nodes with verdict 'yes' and one node with verdict 'no'. The first three nodes (nodes ranked 1,2,3) have a 'yes' verdict but the fourth node has a 'no' verdict. However, the fifth node also has a 'no' verdict which is lower than expected since it provides specific job details that could be used to infer total cores if multiple jobs are considered, and the sixth node confirms this by explaining how to get core information for individual jobs. The seventh node shows output from 'top' command which includes user-specific processes but doesn't directly answer the question about total cores per job or all jobs of a user. The eighth node is irrelevant as it's just memory usage without any job-related details., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.2972972972972973, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to the user's query because it focuses on system processes and CPU usage metrics, while the question is about querying jobs submitted by a specific user (user1) and their core usage., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8571428571428571, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is relevant because it directly addresses the user's question about network speed of a specific model (3F cluster) and provides clear numerical values. The score cannot be higher due to lack of additional context or details, but remains high as it answers the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8333333333333334, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.83 because there was a contradiction in the actual output regarding the compiler version used for compiling the code., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.00 because all nodes with a positive verdict are ranked higher than those with negative ones and there are no irrelevant nodes that should be above relevant ones., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.1728395061728395, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to the input question because it focuses on network speed testing results and performance factors related to WRF simulations, while the user's query specifically asks about the current network speed of a 3F cluster., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.50 because the original text describes TH-3F system network speed test using osu-5.8 program with different MPI versions and node information (nodes [2987-2988]), but it does not explicitly mention or provide details about the current real-time status of the 3F cluster's network speed, which is a key aspect for full contextual recall., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 3F 集群此时的网络速度测试是多少？
  - actual output: 3F 集群的网络速度测试使用osu-5.8程序进行，基于gcc9.3.0编译，测试了不同mpi版本（mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n）的延时和带宽。测试节点为cn[2987-2988]。结果显示，随着数据大小增加，延时和带宽变化明显，其中mpi-x在大部分情况下表现最佳，而mpi-n延时较高。带宽方面，mpi-x在大尺寸数据下具有显著优势。测试数据仅供参考。1. 测试方法：使用osu-5.8程序测试，基于gcc9.3.0编译，测试了不同的mpi版本，包括mpich/mpi-x-gcc9.3.0 + glex、mpich/mpi-x-gcc9.3.0 + tcp、mpich/mpi-n-gcc9.3.0 + tcp。2. 测试节点：测试节点为cn[2987-2988]。3. 测试结果：延时和带宽随数据大小变化明显，其中mpi-x在大部分情况下表现最佳，而mpi-n延时较高。带宽方面，mpi-x在大尺寸数据下具有显著优势。4. 数据示例：例如，在数据大小为1048576时，mpi-x的延时为295.9微秒，带宽为5503.29MB/s；mpi-x + tcp的延时为1697.58微秒，带宽为681.39MB/s；mpi-n的延时为1666.93微秒，带宽为665.71MB/s。5. 结论：测试数据表明，mpi-x在延时和带宽方面表现优于其他两种mpi版本，尤其在大尺寸数据下优势更明显。


  - expected output: TH-3F 系统网络速度测试使用 osu-5.8 程序，基于 gcc9.3.0 编译，采用不同 mpi 版本（mpich/mpi-x-gcc9.3.0 + glex、mpich/mpi-x-gcc9.3.0 + tcp、mpich/mpi-n-gcc9.3.0 + tcp），在 cn [2987-2988] 节点进行测试。延时测试中，当数据 Size 为 0 时，mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n 的 Latency 分别为 4.53us、16.42us、28.08us；Size 为 4194304 时，延时分别为 1141.11us、6404.55us、6376.47us。带宽测试中，Size 为 1 时，mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n 的 Bandwidth 分别为 1.04MB/s、0.11MB/s、0.19MB/s；Size 为 4194304 时，带宽分别为 6956.75MB/s、650.1MB/s、655.16MB/s。由于文件中未提及当前 3F 集群网络速度的实时情况，若要获取当前 3F 集群网络速度，可参考以下方法：使用 osu - 5.8 程序测试：若 3F 集群环境允许再次使用该程序进行测试，需确认集群内有安装 osu - 5.8 程序且已基于 gcc9.3.0 编译。在合适的节点（如之前测试的 cn [2987 - 2988] 节点或根据集群网络架构确定的测试节点）上，运行相应的测试命令。对于延时测试，可执行类似osu_latency -m [mpi版本]的命令（将[mpi版本]替换为实际要测试的 mpi 版本，如 mpi - x、mpi - x + tcp、mpi - n 等）；对于带宽测试，可执行osu_bandwidth -m [mpi版本]的命令 。运行命令后，记录不同数据 Size 下的延时和带宽测试结果，以此获取当前 3F 集群网络速度情况。

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1 because the answer correctly identifies that the performance depends on testing data and provides an appropriate response to the user's query about which storage node is fastest, but it does not explicitly name a specific node or provide any comparison between nodes. The answer remains generic and avoids giving concrete information., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.60 because there are contradictions between the two statements provided in the retrieval context: one claims RHEL8.3 with ZFS version 2.0.3 has an average write speed of approximately 630 MB/s, while another states that RHEL7.8 with ZFS version 0.8.4 has a range of 555-558 MB/s. The actual output does not specify which is the fastest., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.00 because all retrieved contexts (nodes) have a verdict of 'yes' and there are no nodes with 'no'. Therefore, the highest possible score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点是哪台？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点可以通过测试数据进行判断，主要涉及不同操作系统和ZFS版本的性能对比以及OSS存储池的写测试结果。1. RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3的DD满写测试平均速度为630MB/s，而RHEL7.8+ZFS0.8.4的平均速度为555MB/s，这表明RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3的性能更优。2. 在OSS存储池的写测试中，每个节点上的6个存储池的平均写带宽数据通过图表展示，但具体数值未直接给出，因此无法明确指出哪个节点最快。3. 测试过程中出现磁盘空间不足的错误，可能影响了部分测试结果的完整性，但RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3的性能优势仍然显著，因此可以推测使用该配置的节点可能是磁盘IO最快的存储节点。


  - expected output: 通过DD满写测试对不同存储节点的磁盘IO性能进行了对比。在RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3环境下，oss4节点的多个存储池测试速度达到630MB/s以上，其中ost27存储池速度为636MB/s，ost24为644MB/s，ost25为643MB/s；oss5节点的存储池速度在626-632MB/s之间。而RHEL7.8+ZFS0.8.4环境下的oss6、oss7节点速度约为556-558MB/s。由此可见，oss4节点的磁盘IO速度在测试中表现突出。根据经验，若要确定当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点，可进一步通过以下操作验证：1. 执行dd oflag=direct if=/dev/zero of=/ostX/ostX bs=4M命令，对各存储节点的不同存储池进行实时测试，记录各节点的读写速度。 2. 使用iostat -x 1命令，监控各存储节点的磁盘IOPS和吞吐量，获取更详细的IO性能数据。 3. 通过gluster volume status查看存储节点的实时负载情况，结合性能数据判断最快节点。

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.67 because the actual output provided some correct information about memory usage and job scheduling system, but it also included irrelevant statements that did not directly address the query's focus on CPU utilization., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is lower because the retrieval context does not mention CPU core usage or user mode, and while it doesn't directly contradict the claim about exclusivity of yhrun for GPU utilization queries, there might be an implication that other software cannot be queried via yrun due to their absence in the example., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8541666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.85 because the retrieval contexts contain a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. The first two nodes are highly relevant as they directly address high CPU usage in nodes with specific processes consuming high resources, while the third node mentions average but without specifying time period, fourth node confirms lack of clear averages over past hour despite some data on low idle rates, fifth node is partially relevant by mentioning LAMMPS and Python which might be related to system load but doesn't directly address CPU usage query, sixth node provides a method for calculating average CPU usage per core using mpstat command with specific time interval parameter that can infer hourly averages from minute-by-minute data if available. Seventh node is irrelevant as it focuses on GPU querying unrelated to the user's question about CPU., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4827586206896552, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because the retrieval context does not contain any information about nodes or their CPU usage over a specific time period, and it only provides general statements that are either unrelated or incomplete., error: None)

  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，可以总结出以下信息：1. 系统CPU使用率显示多个核心处于100%用户模式（us），表明高CPU负载。大部分CPU核心处于空闲状态（id），但部分核心有少量系统时间（sy）。内存使用情况显示有一定内存被使用，缓存较多。进程列表显示多个gerris2D进程占用100%CPU，表明这些进程正在大量消耗CPU资源。2. 该文本显示了多个进程的运行状态，其中大部分进程属于用户 liudj，进程名为 gerris2D 和 slurm_script，这些进程在高 CPU 使用率（100.0%）下运行，持续时间在 3 分钟左右。此外，还有多个 yhrun 和 bash 进程在低 CPU 使用率下运行，部分进程的 CPU 使用率为 0.0%。整体来看，系统中存在多个并行运行的计算任务。3. 在测试中利用yhrun查询gpu利用率时，发现只有VASP可以通过该方法查询，其他软件如LAMMPS、Python、GROMACS等无法查询，可能与作业调度系统有关。同时，查询过程中出现“Requested nodes are busy”提示，表明节点可能处于忙碌状态。综上所述，过去1小时内，CPU使用率平均超过80%的节点包括：1. 有多个gerris2D进程占用100%CPU的节点，这些进程属于用户liudj，且持续时间在3分钟左右。2. 有多个yhrun和bash进程在低CPU使用率下运行的节点，但部分进程的CPU使用率为0.0%。3. 在测试中出现“Requested nodes are busy”提示的节点，表明这些节点可能处于忙碌状态，因此CPU使用率可能较高。

  - expected output: 系统中部分CPU核心使用率达到100%，如%Cpu10、%Cpu11、%Cpu12的user模式（us）使用率为100%，且进程列表中多个gerris2D进程占用100%CPU，这些进程属于用户liudj，运行在相关节点上，但未明确具体节点名称及过去1小时内的平均CPU使用率情况。根据经验，要查询过去1小时内CPU使用率平均超过80%的节点，可通过以下操作：1. 执行top -b -n 60命令，每1秒采集一次数据，持续1分钟，记录各节点CPU使用率。2. 使用mpstat -P ALL 60 60命令，获取每个CPU核心在过去1小时内的平均使用率。3. 通过iostat -c 60 60命令，查看系统整体CPU使用情况及各节点的平均使用率。4. 利用监控工具如Prometheus，查询过去1小时内的CPU使用率指标，设置阈值超过80%的节点报警。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.8 because the response provided a general explanation about managing compute nodes in maintenance mode but did not explicitly count or list the number of online maintenance compute nodes, and there was an irrelevant statement regarding commands and operations which does not directly address the question., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: , error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7095238095238094, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.71 because there are three yes nodes (nodes ranked 2, 5, and 8) that provide useful context for counting online maintenance compute nodes by discussing node management commands and labels, but four no nodes (ranks 3,4,6,7) do not contain any relevant information about node states or maintenance. However, the score is lower than 1 because some yes nodes might be less directly related; for example, rank 2 mentions 'node_restart' which is a command to restart a single node but doesn't explicitly mention labels like 'maintenance=true'. Rank 5 talks about Java configuration and does not address node states or maintenance. Rank 7 discusses managing partitions without mentioning the specific label used in the question., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5106382978723404, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because it does not mention Einstein's achievements, but focuses on system maintenance tasks and commands for a computing cluster., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5263157894736842, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.53 because there are some matches but also significant mismatches between the expected output sentences and the retrieval context., error: None)

For test case:

  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，当前系统中在线的处于维护状态的计算节点数量无法直接得出。文中提到维护状态通过标签maintenance="true"标记，计算节点通过标签role="compute"区分，但未明确给出具体的节点数量。以下是相关分析：  1. 文档中提及了多个与计算节点相关的命令和操作，例如重启节点、复位计算节点、检查节点状态等，但未提供具体的节点数量信息。  2. 内容中提到节点状态、利用率和告警信息的展示方式，但未明确说明当前处于维护状态的计算节点数量。  3. 虽然有部分关于节点维护和测试的描述，例如挂载文件系统、处理硬盘问题等，但并未涉及具体节点数量的统计或报告。

  - expected output: 数据库中图6-32展示了节点分区状态，包含alloc、down*、drain等状态，但未明确与maintenance="true"和role="compute"标签的对应关系，其他内容也未涉及通过标签标记维护状态节点的信息。根据经验，要查询系统中在线的处于维护状态的计算节点数量，可利用标签筛选功能来准确获取计算节点数量，具体步骤操作如下：    1. 执行kubectl get nodes --selector=role="compute",maintenance="true" -o json命令，获取符合标签条件的计算节点列表。    2. 利用oc get nodes结合标签筛选，查看处于维护状态的计算节点。    3. 通过集群管理工具的API接口，根据标签role="compute"和maintenance="true"查询节点状态。    4. 使用nodectl list --label role=compute --label maintenance=true命令（若系统支持），统计在线维护状态的计算节点数量。

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because the answer does not address the question at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the retrieval context and the actual output, but they are not significant enough to warrant a lower score., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 1.0 indicates that all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant ones, but there is only one node with a 'yes' verdict and one with 'no'. Since the first node (ranked highest) has a positive verdict for the job ID mentioned in the question, it should be at least as high as the second node. However, the score being 1.0 suggests that all nodes are correctly ordered: the relevant node is ranked higher than the irrelevant one., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6451612903225806, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the question because it does not provide information about a specific job ID (32587416) or its runtime on Linux, instead discussing unrelated topics like Einstein's achievements and system processes., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output mentions a specific example (gerris2D) that matches one part of the retrieval context, but misses other details like the four-step process for querying job status on Linux systems., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Linux中正在运行的 32587416 作业的运行时长是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，Linux中正在运行的作业32587416的运行时长无法直接确定，但可以列出相关的信息和可能的线索：1. 在提供的文本中没有直接提到作业ID 32587416的相关信息，因此无法确认其具体运行时长。2. 文本中提到了一些进程的运行时间，例如gerris2D进程的运行时间约为3分51秒，但这与作业ID 32587416无关。3. 其他时间信息如IO操作耗时6.183秒、时间积分总耗时25.739秒等，也未与作业ID 32587416相关联。因此，基于现有内容无法提供作业32587416的运行时长。


  - expected output: 部分进程如gerris2D的运行时间在3分钟左右，QE程序编译和运行耗时从几十分钟到数小时不等。在Linux系统中查询作业运行时长，可通过以下方式：    1. 若作业通过slurm提交，可执行squeue -j 32587416命令，查看作业的TIME字段，该字段会显示作业已运行的时间。    2. 使用ps -ef | grep 32587416找到对应的进程，再通过ps -o etime -p <PID>命令查看进程的运行时长。    3. 若作业有日志记录，可查看日志文件中的开始和结束时间来计算运行时长。    4. 对于后台作业，可通过jobs -l查看作业状态及运行时间。
  - context: None

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is relevant because it provides a list of completed homeworks with their due dates, but there are some irrelevant statements such as 'I am an AI assistant' and other meta-comments that detract from the main content., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.8 indicates that there are some minor inconsistencies or deviations between the actual output and the retrieval context, but overall it remains largely aligned., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.0 because there are no irrelevant nodes (ranked lower) present., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.2692307692307692, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it contains information about building and running computational jobs, including details on build times for various components like esp, sgd, swav, etc., but none of these are related to Albert Einstein or his achievements. The only relevant statements in the context regarding Einstein are that he won a Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect in 1968, which is not directly about user2's submissions and does not address listing completed assignments with their completion times., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.7142857142857143, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.71 because the expected output provides methods to check job completion time by querying user-specific commands (pestat, seff) and log files, which are covered in multiple nodes of the retrieval context but not directly mentioned for all aspects, so it's a partial match., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 查询 user2 提交的所有已完成作业，列出各作业的完成时间？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，可以总结如下：1. 提供的信息中没有直接提到 user2 提交的作业或其完成时间，因此无法列出 user2 提交的已完成作业及其完成时间。2. 文本中提到的命令如 pestat 和 seff 可用于查询作业信息，但未提及 user2 的具体作业数据。3. 其他内容涉及 CESM 模型构建和 CMAQ 模型运行时间报告，但同样未涉及 user2 的作业信息。

  - expected output: 可以通过pestat -u user2查询用户作业，seff <作业ID>查看作业详细信息。根据经验，在Linux系统中查询user2提交的已完成作业及完成时间，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 执行sacct -u user2 -S 2024-01-01 -E 2024-12-31 - state COMPLETED命令，查询user2在指定时间范围内已完成的作业，该命令会显示作业ID、开始时间、结束时间等信息。    2. 使用pestat -u user2 -E选项，查看user2所有作业的结束时间，即完成时间。    3. 若系统使用Slurm调度，可运行slurmdb_dump -u user2 | grep COMPLETED，从Slurm数据库转储中筛选user2的已完成作业及完成时间。    4. 通过日志文件查询，如grep -i user2 /var/log/slurm/slurmctld.log | grep COMPLETED，从日志中查找user2作业的完成记录。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['文本主要介绍了使用 `pestat` 和 `seff` 命令查看作业信息的方法。`pestat` 可用于查询作业的详细状态，支持按用户、分区、作业ID等条件筛选，并提供多种选项控制输出内容。`seff` 用于查看特定作业的运行数据，如状态、节点数、CPU 使用情况等。注意：普通账号仅能查看自身作业。', '该文本记录了一个CESM模型的构建和提交过程。模型构建成功，各组件如esp、wav、docn、sglc、rtm、clm、cam、cice等分别耗时不同时间完成，总构建时间为1513秒。随后提交算例开始计算，生成了组件namelists，检查输入数据，并成功提交了作业。作业状态显示主任务正在运行，归档任务等待依赖完成。附有多个相关参考链接。', '该脚本用于计算和输出CMAQ模型的运行时间报告。首先通过循环累加每天的运行时间得到总时间，再计算平均时间，并格式化输出每日的运行时间、总时间和平均时间。最后提交作业使用yhbatch命令，指定节点数、任务数和分区。', 'home/demo/projects/scratch/f.e20.FXHIST.f19_f19.001/bld/wav.bldlog.211104-163033\nBuilding esp with output to /THL7/home/demo/projects/scratch/f.e20.FXHIST.f19_f19.001/bld/esp.bldlog.211104-163033\nsesp built in 7.171564 seconds\nswav built in 7.498921 seconds\ndocn built in 11.616731 seconds\nsglc built in 22.041355 seconds\nrtm built in 22.043230 seconds\nComponent lnd build complete with 1 warnings\nclm built in 150.639885 seconds\nComponent atm build complete with 13 warnings\ncam built in 249.902774 seconds\nComponent ice build complete with 1 warnings\ncice built in 1278.562084 seconds\nBuilding cesm with output to /THL7/home/demo/projects/scratch/f.e20.FXHIST.f19_f19.001/bld/cesm.bldlog.211104-163033\nTime spent not building: 2.638625 sec\nTime spent building: 1513.239504 sec\nMODEL BUILD HAS FINISHED SUCCESSFULLY\n提交算例，开始计算：\n[demo@th-1a-ln0 f.e20.FXHIST.f19_f19.001]$ ./case.submit\nCreating component namelists\nCalling /THL7/home/demo/projects/cesm2.1.3/components/cam//cime_config/buildnml\nCAM namelist copy: file1 /THL7/home/demo/projects/cases/f.e20.FXHIST.f19_f19.001/Buildconf/camconf/atm_in file2 /THL7/home/demo/projects/scratch/f.e20.FXHIST.f19_f19.001/run/atm_in\nCalling /THL7/home/demo/projects/cesm2.1.3/components/clm//cime_config/buildnml\nCalling /THL7/home/demo/projects/cesm2.1.3/components/cice//cime_config/buildnml\nCalling /THL7/home/demo/projects/cesm2.1.3/cime/src/components/data_comps/docn/cime_config/buildnml\nCalling /THL7/home/demo/projects/cesm2.1.3/components/rtm//cime_', 'set RTMTOT = `echo "${RTMTOT} + ${rt}" | bc -l`\nend\nset RTMAVG = `echo "scale=2; ${RTMTOT} / ${NDAYS}" | bc -l`\nset RTMTOT = `echo "scale=2; ${RTMTOT} / 1" | bc -l`\necho\necho ""\necho "  ***** CMAQ TIMING REPORT *****"\necho ""\necho "Start Day: ${START_DATE}"\necho "End Day:   ${END_DATE}"\necho "Number of Simulation Days: ${NDAYS}"\necho "Domain Name:               ${GRID_NAME}"\necho "Number of Grid Cells:      ${NCELLS}  (ROW x COL x LAY)"\necho "Number of Layers:          ${NZ}"\necho "Number of Processes:       ${NPROCS}"\necho "   All times are in seconds."\necho\necho "Num  Day        Wall Time"\nset d = 0\nset day = ${START_DATE}\nforeach it ( `seq ${NDAYS}` )\n# Set the right day and format it\nset d = `echo "${d} + 1"  | bc -l`\nset n = `printf "%02d" ${d}`\n# Choose the correct time variables\nset rt = `echo ${rtarray} | cut -d\' \' -f${it}`\n# Write out row of', 'the correct time variables\nset rt = `echo ${rtarray} | cut -d\' \' -f${it}`\n# Write out row of timing data\necho "${n}   ${day}   ${rt}"\n# Increment day for next loop\nset day = `date -ud "${day}+1days" +%Y-%m-%d`\nend\necho "     Total Time = ${RTMTOT}"\necho "      Avg.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8333333333333334, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is correct and relevant to the question, but there might be minor improvements for clarity or completeness., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8571428571428571, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.86 indicates that there are some minor inconsistencies or deviations between the actual output and the retrieval context, but overall it remains largely aligned., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7416666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.74 indicates that some irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than relevant ones., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47058823529411764, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about network latency because it focuses on Lustre file system configuration and VASP performance testing, which are unrelated topics. The provided reasons indicate that there is no mention of specific nodes or their network latency values in the retrieved information., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5714285714285714, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.57 because it reflects a moderate level of relevance between the expected output's content on TH-3F system network latency testing and the retrieval context provided., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统中网络延迟最低的节点是哪台？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前系统中网络延迟最低的节点可以通过测试结果进行判断。1. 测试使用的节点是cn[2987-2988]，这些节点进行了不同mpi版本的网络延迟测试，结果显示mpi-x在大部分情况下表现最佳。2. 在测试结果中，mpi-x的延迟值普遍低于mpi-x + tcp和mpi-n，特别是在数据大小较大时，mpi-x的延迟更低，表明其网络性能更优。3. 虽然没有直接指出哪一台节点的延迟最低，但测试节点为cn[2987-2988]，且mpi-x在这些节点上表现最好，因此可以推断这些节点中的某一台可能具有最低的网络延迟。


  - expected output: TH-3F系统使用osu-5.8程序对cn[2987-2988]节点进行了网络延迟测试。在不同数据大小下，mpi-x版本的延迟表现最佳，例如数据大小为0时，mpi-x的延迟为4.53微秒，远低于mpi-x + tcp的16.42微秒和mpi-n的28.08微秒；数据大小为1时，mpi-x延迟4.4微秒，同样优于其他版本。这表明在测试条件下，cn[2987-2988]节点中使用mpi-x版本时网络延迟最低。根据经验，若要确定系统中网络延迟最低的节点，可通过以下操作进一步验证：    1. 执行ping -c 10 <节点IP>命令，获取节点间的网络往返延迟，数值越小表示延迟越低。    2. 使用osu_latency工具（类似文件中的测试方法），在系统各节点间进行延迟测试，直接比较不同节点的延迟数据。    3. 通过ethtool -S <网络接口>查看网络接口的统计信息，分析数据包传输的延迟情况。    4. 利用tracepath <节点IP>命令，追踪数据包路由路径，获取各跳的延迟信息，从而确定延迟最低的节点。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['TH-3F系统网络速度测试使用osu-5.8程序进行，基于gcc9.3.0编译，测试了不同mpi版本（mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n）的延时和带宽。测试节点为cn[2987-2988]。结果显示，随着数据大小增加，延时和带宽变化明显，其中mpi-x在大部分情况下表现最佳，而mpi-n延时较高。带宽方面，mpi-x在大尺寸数据下具有显著优势。测试数据仅供参考。', 'TH-3F系统进行了VASP单节点性能测试，使用CuInS2算例进行结构优化。测试了不同K点设置下的性能，并对比了56核和64核的运行时间。测试中调整了并行参数，包括NPAR=4和KPAR=2。结果显示，64核在sm和tcp模式下性能优于56核glex模式。', 'Lustre 2.3 引入了多项参数和功能，用于优化 MDS 服务线程和网络性能。管理员可通过设置 `_num_threads` 控制线程数量，禁用自动创建。Node Affinity 功能允许将 MDS 线程绑定到特定 CPU 分区（CPT），提升缓存效率和内存局部性。此外，可配置 `mds_num_cpts`、`mds_rdpg_num_cpts` 和 `mds_attr_num_cpts` 来指定线程绑定的 CPT 范围。LNet 参数如 `tx_buffer_size`、`rx_buffer_size` 和 `enable_irq_affinity` 可调整网络性能，而 `credits` 参数影响网络通信的信用值，以适应不同网络环境。路由器缓存区功能则通过分配不同大小的缓冲区来优化消息转发。这些功能为系统调优提供了更多控制选项。',

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because there are multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the user's query about available disk storage space, instead discussing memory (RAM) and swap space which are unrelated to the question., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because while some parts of the output align with the retrieval context (e.g., matching information about OST default reservation), other parts may have potential ambiguities or lack explicit confirmation, leading to uncertainty., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because there are some relevant points about the system load and CPU usage, but it does not directly address the peak time for job ID 45678901 specifically., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.8 because there was a contradiction regarding the CPU usage percentage mentioned in the claim which wasn't present in the retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.5787301587301587, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.58 because there are three 'yes' nodes and two 'no' nodes among the top-ranked contexts, so some irrelevant nodes (nodes ranked 4th and 6th) appear above relevant ones (ranked 2nd, 3rd, 7th, and 9th)., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.24615384615384617, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.25 because the retrieval context does not mention job ID 45678901 or its resource consumption peak time, and all statements provided are either irrelevant or only partially related without providing specific details about this particular job., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because while there are some matches like mentioning CPU usage in node 2 and a command example related to job accounting in node 6, other parts of the expected output do not find direct support from the retrieval context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 系统中正在运行的 45678901 作业的资源消耗峰值出现在什么时候？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，系统中正在运行的作业45678901的资源消耗峰值出现在特定时间点，以下是相关细节：1. 系统负载在某个时间点达到56.16，表明计算任务非常密集，此时CPU使用率接近100%，进程cp2k.popt在多个线程中运行，CPU占用率高达106.7%。2. 在查看进程堆栈时发现进程在epoll_wait中等待，可能与MPI或网络通信有关，这表明资源消耗可能与进程等待状态有关。3. 在计算过程中，某些进程如lapw0、lapw1、lapwso等的CPU使用率较高，例如lapw0的CPU使用率为364.8%，这可能表明这些进程在特定时间点消耗了大量资源。


  - expected output: 从其他作业的资源监控情况来看，如CP2K计算作业在运行时CPU使用率接近100%，负载平均值较高，其资源消耗峰值可通过top命令输出的时间戳（如16:40:36）结合进程运行时间判断。根据经验，获取作业资源消耗峰值时间，可通过以下操作：1. 使用sacct命令：执行sacct -j 45678901 -o start,end,maxcpu,maxmem，查看作业的起止时间及资源消耗峰值的时间点。2. 查看节点监控日志：登录作业所在节点，检查/var/log/collectd.log，通过筛选作业ID对应的CPU、内存使用曲线，确定峰值出现时间。3. 利用htop实时监控：在作业运行时，执行htop -u <作业用户>，实时查看资源消耗，记录峰值出现的系统时间。4. 分析Slurm accounting日志：查看/var/log/slurm/acct.log，通过作业ID筛选记录，获取资源使用峰值的时间戳。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because there are some irrelevant statements in the answer that do not directly address the question about identifying the top 5 nodes with the least disk space and their remaining capacity, although it does provide a general statement about low disk space on node 'ost37' which might be related but lacks specificity., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because the actual output claims an error related to lack of available space while the retrieval context does not contain any information about such errors, focusing instead on general performance metrics., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.0 because all retrieved contexts are relevant and ranked appropriately, with node 2 being irrelevant while node 1 provides useful information about disk space management in Lustre file systems., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: , error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because although there are some relevant points about Lustre file system space reservation and methods for checking disk usage, they lack direct attribution of node numbers and specific details on MDT/OST allocation per node., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 目前磁盘空间剩余最少的 5 台节点分别是哪些？剩余空间是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，磁盘空间剩余最少的节点可以通过日志中的错误信息推断出来，这些错误表明在写入过程中出现了“没有可用空间”的问题。具体节点和剩余空间如下：1. ost33: 由于写入失败，可以推测其磁盘空间已接近或达到上限，但未提供确切剩余空间数值。2. ost34: 同样出现写入错误，表明磁盘空间不足，但未给出具体剩余空间数值。3. ost35: 写入失败，说明磁盘空间可能已满，但无具体剩余空间数据。4. ost36: 出现写入错误，表明磁盘空间不足，但未提供具体剩余空间数值。5. ost37: 写入失败，说明磁盘空间可能已满，但未给出具体剩余空间数值。


  - expected output: Lustre文件系统会预留空间（如ldiskfs预留5%，每个OST预留400MB，MDT预留4GB），且在DD测试中部分OST因空间不足报错（如oss4、oss5的ost24-ost35等），但未明确对应节点的剩余空间数值及排名。根据经验，获取磁盘空间剩余最少的5台节点及剩余空间，可通过以下操作：    1. 执行df命令：登录管理节点，运行df -h | sort -k5 -n，按剩余空间百分比升序排列，查看各文件系统挂载点的剩余空间，结合节点挂载情况定位对应节点。    2. 利用sinfo命令：在Slurm环境下，执行sinfo -o "%N %D %p"，查看节点的磁盘使用情况（%D为磁盘使用率），筛选使用率高的节点。    3. 检查Lustre OST状态：运行lfs df -h，查看各OST的使用情况，结合lctl get_param obdfilter.*.stats获取OST对应的节点信息，定位空间紧张的节点。    4. 使用du命令：针对具体节点，执行du -sh /path/to/mountpoint，查看目录占用空间，结合磁盘总容量计算剩余空间。

For test case:

  - input: 磁盘出现“received cancel for unknown lock cookie”报错，给出具体原因和解决方案。
  - actual output: 磁盘出现“received cancel for unknown lock cookie”报错，具体原因和解决方案如下：1. 该错误通常与 Lustre 文件系统相关，可能由于网络配置或磁盘缓存问题引起。当磁盘缓存未正确提交数据时，可能导致数据丢失或恢复失败。此外，故障切换时若共享存储不一致，也会引发此错误。2. 错误可能源于磁盘设备在数据写入前就声称有数据写入，如果磁盘设备的故障或断电导致缓存丢失，已完成的事务也将丢失。此时应检查磁盘缓存设置，并在重新启动 Lustre 文件系统前运行 e2fsck 检查磁盘损坏问题。3. 如果错误发生在故障转移期间，需检查磁盘缓存设置；如果发生在未进行故障切换的重启后，应尝试确保磁盘写入成功并处理数据。此外，还需与磁盘供应商深入探讨以确认具体原因。


  - expected output: 文件中提到“received cancel for unknown lock cookie”报错的原因是网络配置错误，将IP地址映射到本地主机（127.0.0.1）而非正确IP地址。但文件未给出具体解决方案。根据经验，该报错可能还与以下原因有关：    1. 锁冲突或过期：Lustre文件系统中锁机制出现问题，如客户端持有过期的锁Cookie，或不同客户端之间产生锁竞争，导致服务器收到未知锁Cookie的取消请求。    2. 网络通信异常：网络传输过程中数据丢失、延迟或数据包错误，使服务器接收到的锁Cookie信息不完整或错误，无法识别。    3. 服务器或客户端故障：服务器或客户端节点出现故障、重启或崩溃，导致锁状态信息不一致，服务器无法识别当前锁Cookie。针对以上原因，可采取以下解决方案：    1. 检查网络配置：确认IP地址映射正确，未错误指向127.0.0.1。查看相关网络配置文件（如/etc/hosts、DNS配置等），确保目标服务器的IP地址与主机名正确映射。    2. 处理锁冲突：在Lustre环境中，可使用lctl命令查看和管理锁状态。例如，通过lctl list_locks查看当前锁信息，若发现异常锁，可尝试使用lctl release_lock释放相关锁。    3. 排查网络问题：使用网络工具（如ping、traceroute等）检查网络连通性和延迟，确保网络传输正常。检查防火墙设置，确保相关端口未被阻塞，Lustre通信所需端口（如TCP 988、989等）正常开放。    4. 重启相关服务：若确认是服务器或客户端故障导致，可尝试重启Lustre相关服务（如MDS、OSS等），恢复锁状态信息。在重启前，确保已正确卸载相关文件系统，避免数据丢失。命令如systemctl restart lustre-mds（重启MDS服务）、systemctl restart lustre-oss（重启OSS服务）。    5. 检查磁盘缓存设置：若报错发生在故障转移期间，检查磁盘缓存设置是否正确，确保磁盘缓存一致性，避免因缓存问题导致锁信息丢失或错误。可参考磁盘供应商文档，调整缓存相关参数。

Lustre 文件系统并没有机制能够缓解硬件存储改隐。当服务融无法访问或终止服务时，将无法访问文件。Lustre 2.11 中引入了 Lustre 文件级元余 (FLR) 功能，任何 Lustre 文件都可将相同的数据存储在多台 OST 上，以提升系统在存储故障或其它故障发生时的稳健性。在存在多个针像的情况下，可选择最合适的镜像来啊应单个请求，这对 IO 可用性有直接影啊。此外，对于许多客户闯同时读取的文件〈如输入版，共孚库或可执行文件)，可以通过创建文件数据的多个镜像来提高单个文件的并行聚合读取性能。第一阶段的FLR 功能通过延迟写入实现〈如"图 21.1 FLR EIR GA" 所示)。在写入镜像文件时，只有一个主镜像或首选镜像在写入过程中直接更新，而其他镜像将被标记为stale。通过使用命令行工具《由用户或管理员直接运行或通过目动监控工具运行)同步各镜像之间同步，该文件可在随后再次写入其它镜像。Object j (primary, preferred)delayed resync图 25: FLR delay writting图']

  - input: eX某账号大量作业卡住，如何检查原因？
  - actual output: 针对eX某账号大量作业卡住的问题，可以从多个方面进行检查和分析，具体包括资源分配、内存限制、MPI版本、存储配额以及系统日志等。1. 检查资源分配和内存限制：作业卡住可能由于节点资源不足或内存分配不当引起，可以尝试在yhbatch中指定总内存分配，例如#SBATCH mem=120GB，同时在yhrun命令中添加mem=100GB来限制内存使用，以避免占用全部内存导致无法提交作业。此外，调整vasp作业的核数，如将64核改为56核，也可以减少资源占用。2. 检查MPI版本和编译环境：作业执行失败可能与MPI版本有关，建议替换.bashrc中的编译器和MPI路径。如果程序因编译与运行环境不一致导致AVX支持错误，应移除-xHOST/-xAVX选项，确保编译时使用的优化选项与计算节点的硬件兼容。3. 检查存储配额和IO问题：存储配额默认为500G软限制、1T硬限制，超限将无法写入。如果作业运行提示“forrtl: Input/output error”或“no space left on device”，可能是存储压力大或OST满载导致的IO错误，需要清理数据或联系管理员处理。此外，ls命令卡顿可能因节点负载高、网络延迟或存储恢复引起，可等待或重新尝试。4. 检查系统日志和错误信息：查看作业日志中的错误信息，如“Requested nodes are busy”、“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”、“Aborted”等，这些信息可以帮助定位问题。例如，“Requested nodes are busy”可能是因为yhrun命令分配了所有内存，而“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”可能与内存或I/O操作有关。5. 检查进程引擎和通信库：作业被信号9终止可能与进程引擎故障有关，需检查通信库（如UCX）的配置，例如设置UCX_TLS=sm,tcp,glex。此外，GPU无法识别可能因PCIe连接松动，需检查硬件连接。6. 检查系统维护和作业状态：如果作业在未达到队列时间期限时停止工作，可能是系统维护导致作业被挂起，需手动终止并续算。通过以上步骤，可以系统地排查和解决eX账号作业卡住的问题。


  - expected output: 从其他作业卡住的案例及解决方法可推测可能原因，如节点资源不足（如“Requested nodes are busy”错误）、内存分配问题、MPI版本不兼容、UCX通信库错误、存储配额超限或IO问题等。若eX账号大量作业卡住，可按以下步骤检查原因：    1. 检查节点资源状态：执行sinfo查看集群节点的分配和空闲状态，若大量节点显示“alloc”或“drain”，可能是节点资源不足导致作业无法获取资源而卡住。    2. 查看作业队列和状态：使用yhq或squeue -u eX_account查看作业队列，若作业长时间处于“PD”（pending）状态，可能因资源不足等待调度；若处于“R”（running）但无输出更新，可能程序卡住。    3. 检查内存和CPU使用：对卡住作业所在节点执行top或htop，查看内存是否耗尽、CPU是否被高负载进程占用，若内存不足可尝试通过slurm参数限制内存使用（如mem=100GB）。    4. 分析作业日志：查看作业输出日志（如slurm-*.out），若出现“Requested nodes are busy”，可能节点被其他作业占用；若有“UCX ERROR”或MPI相关错误（如PMIX_Fence failed），可能是通信库或MPI版本问题，可尝试更换MPI版本或调整编译参数。    5. 检查存储配额和IO：执行lfs quota -g eX_account /vol-th查看存储使用情况，若超过软限制（500G）或硬限制（1T），需清理数据；若日志出现“no space left on device”，可能OST满载，需联系管理员检查存储状态。    6. 排查程序本身问题：若作业运行中卡住且无错误日志，可能程序逻辑问题（如死循环），可通过gdbattach进程查看堆栈，或尝试减少核数、调整程序参数（如设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1）重新提交.通过以上步骤逐步排查，可定位eX账号作业卡住的具体原因并针对性解决。例如，若确认是节点资源不足，可等待资源释放或申请更高优先级队列；若为存储配额问题，清理数据后即可恢复作业运行。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because there was no response provided., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.36363636363636365, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score is 0.36 because the actual output contains several contradictions with the retrieval context: (1) The claim about user submissions and homework assignments is unsupported by the context, as there's no mention of such details. (2) The error description in the claim includes specific tests not mentioned in the context, though some are partially matched. (3) The cause of the issue is attributed to resource competition which isn't explicitly stated but could be inferred; however, the context specifies PMIx library issues as the root cause., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 1.0 indicates all retrieved nodes are relevant, as evidenced by the first node providing specific information on test failures and causes, while the second node is irrelevant but ranked lower due to its lack of relevance., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.7021276595744681, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input query because it focuses on a specific software error related to job submission and execution failures, while the user's question pertains to Einstein's achievements or failures (likely referring to his scientific work). The statements about Einstein are incorrect regarding the year of the Nobel Prize award. There is no mention of 'user3' in the context at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.8333333333333334, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.83 because there are several points where the expected output aligns with the retrieval context: node 2 discusses PMIx_Fence errors related to MPI collective operations timeout; node 4 addresses multiple job submissions causing communication issues, which matches the general problem described in the sentence about resource management problems; node 0 and node 2 mention using sacct command for debugging, matching part of the expected output. However, there is one point where it does not align: the specific error mentioned in node 3 (Segmentation fault) is covered but the expected output doesn't directly reference that node or its exact content except through other nodes.', , error: None)

  - input: 查询 user3 提交的所有失败作业，列出各作业的失败原因？
  - actual output: user3提交的失败作业及其失败原因如下：1. cv_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。2. beyondRTA_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。3. analytic1D_basicprop_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。4. analytic1D_psi_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。5. analytic1D_SPR_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。6. kappa_Tsweep_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。7. cumulativecurves_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。8. transient_analytic1d_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。9. steady_montecarlo1d_test失败，具体原因未明确提及，但可能与测试环境或代码逻辑有关。此外，系统在运行过程中出现错误，提示“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”，涉及地址和长度信息，可能与内存或I/O操作有关。随后出现多个UCX错误日志，均指向glex_md.c文件的362行，表明在注册用户缓冲区时发生问题。最后，任务被中止，显示“Aborted”和“STEP 3596459. ON cn1944 CANCELLED AT”，表明作业执行失败，可能与通信库或资源管理器相关。3M系统在脚本中提交多个多节点作业时，出现作业无法正常结束的问题。第一个作业可正常完成，其余作业运行结束后卡住，最终被取消，并报错。错误信息显示与MPI的集体操作超时有关，涉及PMIx库的故障。问题可能与多作业并发执行时的资源竞争或通信机制有关，需优化脚本或调整作业提交方式以解决。


  - expected output: 从其他作业失败案例来看，失败原因包括MPI集体操作超时（如PMIxFence返回错误导致作业取消）、内存访问错误（如SIGSEGV分段错误）、UCX通信库错误（如glexmd.c文件报错）、测试用例自身问题（如测试代码逻辑错误或依赖缺失）等。根据经验，查询user3提交的失败作业及原因，可通过以下操作：    1. 执行sacct -u user3 -s FAILED -o JobID,ExitCode,AllocNodes,FailReason命令，获取user3的失败作业列表及系统记录的失败原因。例如，若sacct显示失败原因为“Timeout”，则需检查作业运行时间是否超过队列限制；若日志中出现“Segmentation fault”，则可能是程序内存访问越界导致。    2. 查看Slurm作业日志，路径通常为/var/log/slurm/jobid.out，分析作业运行过程中的错误输出。    3. 使用yhq -u user3查看作业状态，结合scontrol show job jobid获取详细失败信息。    4. 若作业涉及MPI程序，检查mpirun或yhrun的错误日志，如/tmp/mpirun.err。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is relevant but could be improved by providing more specific details about common causes of task runtime interruptions and how to check them., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: , error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8083333333333332, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score of 0.81 indicates a good level of relevance, but not perfect. The top-ranked nodes (nodes ranked 1 and 2) are highly relevant as they address specific causes like process engine failure due to MPI issues and node division problems in the context of task interruption. Node 4 is also relevant discussing I/O errors from Lustre file system. However, there are two irrelevant nodes that might be pulling down the score: node 3 discusses storage quotas which could cause interruptions indirectly but not directly as per user query; node 5 talks about compilation errors unrelated to runtime interruptions. The presence of these two no verdicts at positions 3 and 6 reduces the precision by introducing less relevant contexts., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5106382978723404, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on technical system errors and solutions related to Slurm, storage quotas, I/O issues, GPU compatibility, and network problems, while the input query specifically asks about Einstein's achievements. There is no mention of Albert Einstein or his accomplishments in the retrieved statements., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.875, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.88 because there are several strong matches between the expected output and the retrieval context, such as the job submission script (node 1), MPI configuration issues (node 2), storage problems (node 3 and node 5), ls command issues (node 4), GPU recognition issue (node 5). However, some sentences in the expected output are not directly supported by any specific node or have weak connections. For example, the general advice to check node allocation might be loosely related but lacks direct evidence from nodes mentioned., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 存在任务运行时中断的问题，请检查原因。
  - actual output: 任务运行时中断可能由多种原因引起，包括系统故障、资源限制、编译环境不一致以及作业管理问题等。1. 系统故障可能导致任务中断，例如进程引擎故障或信号9终止，这通常与MPI版本有关，建议替换.bashrc中的编译器和MPI路径。2. 作业可能因系统维护被挂起，此时会显示“yhrun: got SIGCONT”提示，需手动终止并续算。3. 程序编译与运行环境不一致也可能导致中断，例如程序编译时使用了支持AVX的选项，但运行时的硬件不支持，应移除-xHOST/-xAVX选项。4. 存储问题如磁盘配额超限或IO错误也可能导致任务中断，用户需清理存储或重新提交作业。5. 资源分配问题如无法将节点划分为指定数量可能导致任务失败，需检查节点分配设置。6. GPU使用问题如PCIe连接松动也可能导致任务中断，需检查硬件连接。7. 作业管理问题如作业状态显示为R运行但实际停止工作，需手动杀掉作业并续算。


  - expected output: 任务运行时中断可能由多种原因导致。例如，EX系统CESM2.1.3在无报错情况下中断，可正常断点续算，建议使用特定脚本提交作业；进程引擎故障导致作业被信号9终止，可能是MPI版本问题，需替换.bashrc中的编译器和MPI路径；作业可能因系统维护被挂起，需手动终止并续算；程序编译与运行环境不一致，如AVX支持错误，应移除-xHOST/-xAVX选项；存储配额超限会导致无法写入，IO错误可能由存储压力或OST满载引起；ls命令卡顿可能因节点负载高、网络延迟或存储恢复；GPU无法识别可能因PCIe连接松动；还有无法将节点合理划分、MPI_Topo_test函数调用失败等问题导致任务中断。综合来看，任务运行时中断可从多方面检查原因。    1. 检查作业提交方式，若使用EX系统CESM2.1.3，可尝试使用指定脚本提交，脚本内容为：#!/bin/bash # SBATCH -p cp6 # SBATCH -N 10 # SBATCH -n 560 export GLEX_USE_ZC_RNDV=0 ./case.submit。    2. 排查MPI版本及相关配置，若出现进程引擎故障、被信号9终止的情况，用/vol6/source.sh中的内容替换原~/.bashrc中关于intel编译器、mpi的路径。接着，关注系统维护情况，若作业运行中输出slurm文件出现yhrun: got SIGCONT，说明作业被挂起，可手动杀掉作业并从断点续算。    3. 检查程序编译与运行环境的一致性，若报错提示不支持AVX，编译时去掉-xHOST/-xAVX选项。再检查存储相关问题，查看存储配额是否超限，lfs quota –g username /vol-th命令查看，若超限则清理数据；若提示IO错误或无空间，可能是存储压力大或某一OST已满，可重新提交作业或联系工程师。对于ls命令卡顿，可等待后重试。若GPU无法识别，提交作业时可尝试相关解决方法。    4. 检查节点划分和MPI通信器问题，确保节点数量能合理划分，避免出现无效通信器错误。通过以上步骤逐步排查，可定位任务运行时中断的原因。

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly addressing the user's question about checking reasons for ES cluster resource service startup failure. It provides a general introduction to Elasticsearch and mentions specific commands but does not explain how to check the cause of the error or provide troubleshooting steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.7, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.7 because there are two main issues: first, a typo was found where 'glex_md.c' should be verified against actual system files as it might not exist; second, the claim states that restarting glusterd service addresses memory or I/O operations problems directly but the retrieval context only suggests these errors may relate to such issues without explicitly confirming them., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8083333333333332, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.81 because there are some relevant nodes that should be ranked higher, but they are not., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.3582089552238806, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because it does not provide any specific information about checking the cause of ES cluster user resource interface service startup failure. The provided reasons for irrelevance include that the context lacks details on how to check causes, and there are multiple irrelevant statements such as 'Einstein won the Nobel Prize' which is unrelated to Elasticsearch issues., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output mentions an error message that matches a specific node (node 5) but there are other sentences lacking support from the retrieval context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: es集群用户统一资源接口服务启动失败，如何检查原因？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，es集群用户统一资源接口服务启动失败可能涉及多个方面的问题，需要从系统错误日志、通信库问题以及资源管理器等方面进行检查。1. 系统错误日志分析：检查是否有“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”等错误提示，这类错误通常与内存或I/O操作有关，可能涉及地址和长度信息，需进一步排查相关硬件或软件配置。2. 通信库问题：查看UCX错误日志，特别是glex_md.c文件的362行，表明在注册用户缓冲区时发生问题，这可能与通信库的配置或版本不兼容有关，需确认通信库是否正常运行及版本是否匹配。3. 资源管理器相关问题：任务被中止并显示“Aborted”和“STEP 3596459. ON cn1944 CANCELLED AT”，这可能与资源管理器的配置或资源分配有关，需检查资源管理器的日志和配置，确保资源分配合理且无冲突。此外，还需结合运维平台的报警信息和故障记录，查看是否有其他相关故障点，如TH-3F或TH-HPC的握手次数变化、raid1和raid2超时故障等，这些都可能间接影响到服务的启动。同时，可以参考GlusterFS系统的故障处理方法，如检查自愈进程、配额进程、服务器连接数减少、Brick不可用等问题，并按照相应的解决步骤进行排查。最后，如果以上步骤未能解决问题，建议联系技术支持团队进行深入分析和处理。


  - expected output: 系统运行中出现“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”错误，涉及地址和长度信息，可能与内存或I/O操作有关，随后有多个指向glex_md.c文件362行的UCX错误日志，表明注册用户缓冲区时出现问题，最后任务中止，显示作业执行失败，可能与通信库或资源管理器相关。从这些信息来看，ES集群用户统一资源接口服务启动失败，可从以下方面检查原因。    1. 检查内存资源状态：使用free -h命令查看系统内存占用情况，确认是否存在内存不足导致用户缓冲区注册失败的情况。若内存使用率过高，可通过关闭无关进程释放资源，或检查是否有内存泄漏问题。    2. 排查 I/O 操作异常：执行df -h查看存储设备挂载及空间使用情况，确认是否有磁盘空间不足或文件系统错误。运行dmesg | grep -i error或dmesg | grep disk命令，检查磁盘 I/O 错误日志，判断是否存在磁盘硬件故障或读写异常。    3. 检查通信库与 UCX 组件：查看 UCX 相关日志（如文档中提到的 glex_md.c:362 错误），确认通信库是否存在版本不兼容或配置错误。尝试重新安装或更新 UCX 通信库，命令参考：yum install ucx -y，并检查库文件路径是否正确。    4. 排查资源管理器与作业调度：查看 Slurm 或相关资源管理器日志，确认是否存在作业调度异常或进程管理错误。检查是否有未释放的资源锁或僵死进程，可通过ps -ef | grep slurm或kill -9 <进程ID>清理异常进程。    5. 检查 Lustre 存储状态：若涉及 Lustre 存储，按文档步骤挂起对应分区作业：通过运维平台找到对应存储分区（如 mds1 对应 THL6），执行 “作业操作” 中的挂起操作。ssh mds1登录存储节点，通过cat /var/log/messages | grep -i mds1命令查看日志是否有-30或scsi cmnd错误，若无则通过systemctl restart lustre-mds命令重启 mds 节点。    6. 系统综合日志排查：查看系统全局错误日志/var/log/messages或/var/log/syslog，搜索与服务启动相关的报错信息（如 “user buffer datatype”），定位具体模块故障。检查服务启动脚本是否存在权限不足或路径错误，可通过systemctl status es-service查看服务启动日志。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.75 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the retrieval context and the actual output., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8303571428571428, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.83 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes with verdict yes) out of seven total nodes, but two irrelevant nodes appear higher than some relevant ones., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.36363636363636365, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context does not address the cause of NaN values in Einstein's achievements; it discusses technical errors related to software and network issues, which are unrelated., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.67 because there are some matches but not all expected points are covered., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 任务运行出现NaN，原因是什么？
  - actual output: 任务运行出现NaN的原因可能包括以下几点：1. 程序在运行过程中因代理连接失败导致异常退出。错误信息显示无法连接到代理，网络不可达，进而引发与 wandb 通信失败，最终导致程序异常终止。traceback 显示错误发生在训练过程中的回调函数调用期间，具体是 wandb 初始化时出现问题。该问题可能影响模型训练的记录和跟踪功能。2. HPC4及3K运行deepmd-gromacs时出现报错“Step 0: The total potential energy is -nan”，提示能量值非有限，可能由坐标值过大、初始结构未平衡或参数错误引起。解决方法为取消环境变量GMX_DEEPPD_INPUT_JSON的设置，以避免潜在冲突。3. 数据数值过大可能导致计算过程中出现NaN值，例如NCL画图速度过慢的问题，经排查发现是数据数值过大导致，将数据除以10^27后问题解决。


  - expected output: 任务运行出现NaN可能由多种原因导致。在HPC4及3K运行deepmd-gromacs时，报错显示总势能为-nan，可能是坐标值过大、初始结构未平衡或参数错误引起，解决方法为取消环境变量GMX_DEEPMD_INPUT_JSON的设置；另外，数据数值过大也可能引发类似问题，如NCL画图速度过慢，将数据除以10^27后问题得到解决。综合来看，任务运行出现NaN可从以下方面检查原因。    1. 检查初始结构和参数配置，查看坐标值是否存在异常过大的情况，确认初始结构是否平衡，同时检查拓扑文件中的相互作用参数是否正确，这有助于排除因结构或参数问题导致的NaN现象。    2. 排查环境变量设置，若使用deepmd-gromacs，可执行unset GMX_DEEPMD_INPUT_JSON命令取消相关环境变量，避免其引发潜在冲突。    3. 关注数据本身的数值大小，若数据数值过大，可对数据进行归一化处理，例如将数据除以适当的倍数（如10的幂次方），以解决因数据数值异常导致的问题。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5714285714285714, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is lower because the actual output claims login failure due to service issues or vulnerabilities without specifying them, and suggests a specific file copy location based on user's username while the retrieval context doesn't provide such details., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.00 because all retrieved nodes are relevant and ranked appropriately, with the first two being directly related to login failure causes (missing ca.crt file) and providing solutions, while the third node is irrelevant as it does not mention NCHUZL account or login issues., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47761194029850745, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on various vulnerabilities and security updates in software packages like openssh, gnuplot, bash, etc., but none of these are directly related to the specific issue of login failure for an account named 'NCHUZL'. The user's query is about diagnosing why a particular account failed to log in, while the context discusses vulnerabilities unrelated to authentication processes or VPN configurations. For example, statements like "Ubuntu Exiv2整数溢出漏洞" and others are about software vulnerabilities that do not pertain to login issues., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 账号NCHUZL统一登录失败的原因是什么？
  - actual output: 账号NCHUZL统一登录失败的原因可能包括多个方面，具体如下：1. 账号NCHUZL在登录过程中可能涉及到服务启用和用户验证的问题，需要确保相关服务如nslcd和nscd已正确启动并配置，同时检查用户是否存在以及权限是否正确。2. 登录节点可能存在安全漏洞，例如openssh、gnuplot、bash、libcurl、ghostscript等软件的CVE漏洞，这些漏洞可能导致登录失败或被系统阻止，需更新相关组件以修复安全问题。3. 如果是通过VPN进行登录，可能由于缺少ca.crt文件导致连接报错，解决方法是将ca.crt文件复制到指定路径，并替换用户名为实际用户名，确保文件路径正确无误。


  - expected output: 账号NCHUZL统一登录失败可能与以下原因有关：VPN连接问题，如缺少ca.crt文件会导致连接报错，需将文件拷贝到指定路径；VPN登录时可能存在已登录其他VPN、网络问题等，可通过修复VPN、重启电脑等方法解决；系统服务未正常启动，如nslcd和nscd服务未启动可能影响用户登录；登录节点存在安全漏洞，如openssh、bash等组件的漏洞可能导致登录异常。综合来看，可从以下方面排查账号NCHUZL统一登录失败的原因。    1. 检查VPN连接是否正常，若连接时报错缺少ca.crt文件，将其拷贝到指定路径（如用户名\OpenVPN\config\相关配置路径）。    2. 确认是否存在同时登录其他VPN的情况，若有则断开其他连接，还可在青索界面尝试修复VPN或重启电脑后再登录。    3. 检查系统服务状态，使用systemctl status nslcd和systemctl status nscd命令查看服务是否启动，若未启动则执行systemctl start nslcd和systemctl start nscd命令，并设置为开机自启。    4. 考虑登录节点的安全漏洞影响，可联系管理员检查系统是否存在openssh、bash等组件的漏洞，及时更新相关组件修复漏洞。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.8 because there are some irrelevant statements in the output that do not directly address the user's query about diagnosing a 'communication connection failure' error when submitting a job with yhrun on an HPC cluster, despite providing relevant information about checking network connectivity and firewall issues which could be related to communication problems., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.45454545454545453, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.45 because there are several contradictions: The command mentioned in the claim (yhrun) isn't supported by PBS; node failure handling instructions differ, with the retrieval context not mentioning any specific parameters like -x or contacting administrators; while both mention checking permissions, the method differs slightly as one specifies direct permission check and the other suggests verifying queue and resource limits. Also, the claim mentions using yhi to view queues but the retrieval context only uses it in case of permission errors. Finally, system logs are not explicitly mentioned for error analysis in the retrieval context which instead focuses on job log files., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.50 because there are three nodes with verdict 'yes' and two nodes with verdict 'no'. The first yes node (node index 2) discusses yhbatch as an alternative to yhrun, which directly addresses the user's issue of using yhrun causing instability. However, the second yes node (node index 5) talks about clocksource errors affecting job execution and suggests a solution involving draining nodes, which is relevant but not directly tied to the 'communication connection failure' error mentioned in the query. The third yes node (node index 6) provides information on handling file copy errors, which might be tangentially related if we consider system-level issues, but it doesn't specifically address communication failures. There are two no nodes that don't provide any relevant information to the user's specific issue., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6571428571428571, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.66 because the retrieval context provided does not directly address the specific error message or troubleshooting steps for an SSH connection failure with the command 'hostname' on an HPC cloud system named 'hpc云 ypz2019'. While there are some general statements about HPC systems and job management, they do not provide a direct solution to this particular issue., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output provides relevant advice for troubleshooting but does not fully align with all aspects of the retrieval context nodes, such as node time synchronization and command execution issues., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: hpc云 ypz2019 账号，使用 yhrun 命令提交 hostname 命令，提示 communication connection failure，如何排查原因？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，使用 yhrun 命令提交 hostname 命令时提示 communication connection failure，可能涉及网络、节点状态、权限或配置问题。排查原因可从以下方面进行：1. 检查节点状态和网络连接，确保计算节点正常且与管理节点通信无误，若存在节点故障，可通过 -x 参数剔除问题节点并联系管理员处理。2. 确认作业提交方式是否稳定，建议使用 yhbatch 提交作业以避免因终端关闭或登录节点宕机导致任务中断。3. 检查权限和资源限制，确认用户是否有权限使用指定队列及申请的资源是否符合要求，若提示权限错误，需通过 yhi 命令查看可用队列并调整资源申请。4. 验证环境配置，包括动态库路径和环境变量，确保计算节点与登录节点的软件环境一致，必要时设置 LD_LIBRARY_PATH 或复制所需命令至计算节点。5. 查看系统日志，分析作业日志中的具体错误信息，如时间不同步、内存不足或 MPI 运行错误等，针对性解决。6. 确保文件名和路径无特殊字符或错误，避免因文件不存在或路径问题导致通信失败。7. 若问题持续，联系管理员进一步检查节点状态和系统配置。


  - expected output: 使用yhrun命令提交hostname命令提示communication connection failure，可能与网络连接、节点时间不同步、MPI运行错误或节点问题有关。例如，作业断开时slurm日志出现“Job credential expired”是计算结点时间未与管理结点同步，可加-x剔除问题结点并联系管理员；MPI运行错误如“progress engine failure”可能由网络或节点问题引起，需联系管理员处理。综合来看，可从以下方面排查原因。    1. 检查网络连接是否正常，确保VPN连接稳定，若连接时报错缺少ca.crt文件，将其拷贝到指定路径（如用户名\OpenVPN\config\相关配置路径）。    2. 查看slurm日志，若出现时间同步相关报错，使用date命令查看计算节点和管理节点时间，若不同步，提交作业时加-x剔除问题结点并联系管理员同步时间。    3. 若日志提示MPI相关错误，如“progress engine failure”，可能是网络或节点故障，联系管理员检查处理。    4. 检查作业提交方式，建议使用yhbatch替代yhrun提交作业，避免因终端关闭等导致任务异常。通过以上步骤逐步排查，可定位并解决通信连接失败问题。

  - input: 如何让HPC云显示使用的机时量？
  - actual output: 为了使HPC云显示使用的机时量，可以通过以下方法实现：1. 使用GPU机时查询功能测试（V1.3.3）中的命令，首先加载环境变量PATH，然后使用thGpuConfig配置用户的GPU统计开始时间和机时量，支持新增、修改和删除配置；同时使用thGpuUsage查询用户GPU使用情况，包括任务数、已用卡时、总卡时等信息。2. 修改脚本以查询HPC4 GPU利用率，在sub.sh中于yhrun语句前添加“nvidia-smi dmon > nvi_1.log &”可持续记录GPU利用率，若需限制时间，则可添加timeout命令。3. 通过TH-HPC4 GPU分区统计机时（临时版）方案，该方案针对GPU分区的计算资源使用情况进行统计，提供更准确的机时记录，以便更好地管理与分配计算资源。这些方法能够帮助用户和管理员有效监控和管理HPC云中的GPU资源使用情况。

  - expected output: 针对HPC4 GPU分区有临时版机时统计方案，还有GPU机时查询功能测试的相关命令，如thGpuConfig用于配置用户GPU统计开始时间和机时量，thGpuUsage用于查询用户GPU使用情况，此外还可通过修改脚本查询HPC4 GPU利用率。具体操作如下：    1. 配置环境变量：执行export PATH=/fs1/software/gpuacct/bin:$PATH，加载GPU机时查询功能。    2. 配置用户机时统计：使用thGpuConfig命令配置账号的GPU统计开始时间和机时量。例如，thGpuConfig -u 用户名 -t total -s 2023-01-01 -c 1000可配置总GPU卡时；thGpuConfig -u 用户名 -d可删除配置。    3. 查询机时使用情况：通过thGpuUsage命令查询。直接执行thGpuUsage可查自己的使用情况；thGpuUsage -u 用户名可查指定用户；thGpuUsage -u 用户名 -s 开始日期 -e 结束日期可查指定时间段内的使用情况；thGpuUsage -A可查全部用户。    4. 查询GPU利用率：在提交作业的脚本（如sub.sh）中，于yhrun语句前添加nvidia-smi dmon > nvi_1.log &，可从程序运行开始到结束一直记录GPU利用率；若添加timeout 1m nvidia-smi dmon > nvi_1.log &，则只在规定时间内记录。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly relevant to the question, but it provides some related information about troubleshooting high CPU usage and memory issues. The score remains 0.5 because while there are some tangentially connected points (like checking system logs), they don't address the specific issue of I/O bottlenecks or disk performance problems that would cause high read/write bandwidth usage., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.75 because there are some contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. One contradiction is that the retrieval context mentions a hard limit of 1TB but not specifically about high I/O load, while the actual output implies it might be due to high I/O load., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7095238095238094, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.71 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes ranked 3,4 and 8) that provide solutions or related information about resource allocation issues which could be linked to the input's problem of high read-write bandwidth usage causing job suspension. However, two irrelevant nodes (nodes ranked 2 and 6) are incorrectly included in the top-ranked results, pulling down the score., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it primarily discusses issues related to node availability, storage quotas, and compiler settings for CPU instructions (AVX), but does not address read-write bandwidth specifically. Although there are some statements about resource allocation and optimization that might tangentially relate, they do not directly tackle the I/O performance issue., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because there are some elements that align with the expected output but others do not have direct support., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何解决ex系统任务读写带宽占用过高挂起问题？
  - actual output: 针对ex系统任务读写带宽占用过高导致的挂起问题，可以从以下几个方面进行解决：1. 检查存储配额和IO状态，确保没有超过磁盘配额限制，同时确认存储系统是否处于高负载或恢复状态，必要时联系管理员进行调整；2. 优化作业的IO操作，避免在高峰时段执行大量读写任务，合理分配计算资源，减少对存储系统的压力；3. 检查作业脚本中的内存和CPU资源分配设置，适当调整参数如核数、内存限制等，以降低对系统资源的占用，提高作业运行效率。


  - expected output: TH-3F系统运行calypso.x和vasp时因节点资源不足或内存分配不当出现作业无法提交的情况，解决方法包括调整核数、限制内存使用等；ES系统JUPYTER报错内存占用过高，可通过设置环境变量解决；此外，存储配额超限、IO错误等也可能引发类似问题。具体解决步骤如下：    1. 调整作业资源配置：减少作业使用的核数，如将vasp作业核数从64改为56，避免因核数过多导致资源占用过高。在yhrun命令中添加内存限制参数，如mem=100GB，限制作业使用的内存量，可根据实际情况调整数值。    2. 优化程序运行方式：使用mpi-n编译的vasp，并通过mpirun调用，这种方式可能在一定程度上降低资源占用，虽然计算速度可能略慢，但能解决因编译方式导致的问题。    3. 设置程序参数：在vasp运行时，设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1，优化计算过程中的参数配置，提高资源利用效率，减少带宽占用。    4. 处理内存相关问题：若遇到TensorFlow分配内存超过系统可用内存10%的情况，将CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES设为0或注释掉这行，也可在代码开头添加os.environ['TF_XLA_FLAGS'] = 'tf_xla_enable_xla_devices'，解决内存占用过高的问题。    5. 检查存储情况：使用lfs quota –g username /vol-th命令查看账号存储配额，若存储使用超过软限制500G或硬限制1T，清理数据至限额以下，避免因存储问题影响读写。    6. 处理IO错误：若作业运行提示“forrtl: Input/output error”，可能是存储压力大导致，可重新提交作业；若提示“forrtl: No space left on device”，可能是某一OST存储已满，联系工程师或系统管理员处理。通过以上步骤对作业资源配置、程序运行方式、内存使用及存储情况等方面进行调整和优化，可有效解决EX系统任务读写带宽占用过高导致的挂起问题。在操作过程中，需根据实际情况灵活调整参数和设置，并及时与相关技术人员沟通处理存储等方面的问题。

For test case:

  - input: 用户通过脚本提交多个多节点 MPI 作业时，首个作业正常完成，后续作业运行结束后卡住并因 PMIx 集体操作超时被取消，报错信息显示与pmixp_coll_ring超时相关。请分析可能的故障原因，并给出优化方案。
  - actual output: 可能的故障原因包括资源竞争、通信机制问题和配置不当，优化方案涉及调整脚本、优化通信参数和改进资源管理。1. 资源竞争可能导致后续作业在释放资源时出现阻塞，尤其是在多节点作业并发执行时，共享资源如网络带宽或内存可能成为瓶颈，导致PMIx集体操作无法及时完成，从而引发超时。2. 通信机制问题可能与MPI库的实现有关，例如在使用MPICH时，某些集体操作（如mpi_gather）可能未采用最优的分层通信策略，导致节点内和节点间通信交织，影响性能并引发超时。3. 配置不当可能涉及UCX_TLS参数设置不合理，例如使用sm通信可能导致节点内和节点间通信交织，而改为glex可以避免这一问题，提升通信效率。优化方案包括调整脚本以减少并发作业数量或增加间隔时间，避免资源竞争；优化UCX_TLS参数，尝试使用glex代替sm以改善通信性能；检查并调整MPI库的配置，确保集体操作正确执行，并考虑升级到更高版本的MPI库以获得更好的稳定性和性能。此外，监控系统资源使用情况，确保每个作业有足够的资源运行，也是解决此类问题的重要措施。


  - expected output: 用户通过脚本提交多个多节点MPI作业时，首个作业正常完成，后续作业运行结束后卡住，因PMIx集体操作超时被取消，报错与pmixpcollring超时相关。类似问题在3M系统中出现过，脚本内提交多个多节点作业时，仅首个作业正常完成，其余作业运行完成后卡在结束位置，报错显示pmixpcollring集体操作超时，如“collective timeout seq=1”，且作业状态为S，持续一段时间后被cancel。此外，jorek程序测试中发现mpigather耗时异常，调整UCXTLS参数（将sm,glex改为glex）后问题解决，推测sm通信可能导致节点内与节点间通信交织影响性能。故障原因分析：    资源竞争与通信冲突：多个多节点MPI作业并发执行时，可能争夺网络资源或PMIx通信通道，导致后续作业的集体操作（如ring算法）因资源不足或调度混乱而超时。首个作业优先获取资源正常完成，后续作业因资源被占用或通信链路拥堵，无法及时完成集体操作。    UCXTLS参数配置不当：若作业使用的UCXTLS参数包含sm（共享内存），可能在多节点多进程场景下，节点内通信与节点间通信交织，影响MPI集体操作效率，导致超时。如jorek案例中，sm通信使节点内和节点间通讯冲突，改为glex后性能恢复。    PMIx库或MPI实现问题：PMIx集体操作的ring算法在多作业场景下可能存在缺陷，如状态管理异常、超时机制不合理，导致后续作业的ring操作无法正常完成，触发超时取消。    作业提交脚本逻辑问题：脚本提交多个作业时，若没有合理的间隔或资源预留机制，可能导致后续作业在启动时资源（如网络连接数、PMIx上下文）未正确释放或初始化，引发集体操作超时。优化方案：    调整UCXTLS参数：尝试修改UCXTLS参数，避免使用sm或调整参数顺序，如将UCX_TLS=sm,glex改为UCX_TLS=glex，减少节点内与节点间通信冲突。可在作业脚本中添加export UCX_TLS=glex。    增加作业提交间隔：在脚本中设置提交间隔，避免连续提交作业导致资源竞争。例如，使用sleep 5在每次提交作业后等待5秒。    检查PMIx相关环境变量：确认PMIx相关环境变量配置正确，如PMIX_TIMEOUT可适当增大，设置export PMIX_TIMEOUT=300（单位秒，根据实际情况调整）。    使用作业依赖或队列机制：通过作业调度系统的依赖功能，确保后续作业在前一个作业完成后提交，避免并发冲突。例如，使用SLURM的--dependency=afterok:JOBID参数。    更新MPI库或PMIx版本：若当前MPI库或PMIx版本存在已知bug，尝试升级到最新稳定版本，修复集体操作中的潜在问题。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.7, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.7 because there are several statements in the actual output that address parts of the question but do not fully resolve it, such as discussing specific errors and general error handling without providing a complete explanation or solution for UCX ERROR specifically., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.67 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the retrieval context and the actual output., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7095238095238094, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.71, which indicates that some relevant nodes are being ranked lower than they should be because there are irrelevant nodes appearing above them., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.7692307692307693, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not highly relevant to the user's query about Einstein and his Nobel Prize because it focuses on a technical error related to UCX (Universal Communication eXtra) in a distributed computing environment, specifically an error with creating regions due to insufficient memory resources. The only mention of Einstein is unrelated and appears to be an error or irrelevant inclusion., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: EX系统用户作业报 UCX ERROR 错误的原因和解决方法是什么？
  - actual output: 系统在运行过程中出现UCX错误，主要涉及地址和长度信息，可能与内存或I/O操作有关，同时多个日志显示在glex_md.c文件的362行发生错误，表明在注册用户缓冲区或创建GLEX区域时出现问题，任务因此被中止。此外，UCX编译过程中出现对packed结构体成员取地址导致未对齐指针的问题，引发警告并被当作错误处理。日志还显示在特定节点上因内存资源不足导致GLEX区域创建失败。1. UCX错误的原因包括：一是系统在注册用户缓冲区时出现错误，可能与内存或I/O操作相关；二是编译过程中因packed结构体成员取地址导致未对齐指针的问题；三是创建GLEX区域时因内存资源不足而失败。2. 解决方法包括：对于编译错误，可在configure后删除src/uct/glex/Makefile中的-Werror选项；对于内存资源不足的问题，需检查并优化内存分配或资源管理；对于注册用户缓冲区的问题，需排查内存或通信库配置是否正确。3. 其他建议包括检查系统日志以获取更多上下文信息，并确保使用的UCX版本无已知问题。


  - expected output: EX系统用户作业报UCX ERROR错误的原因主要有以下几点：一是注册用户缓冲区数据类型时出现输入/输出错误，可能与内存或I/O操作有关；二是UCX编译时因结构体对齐问题报错，如对packed结构体成员取地址导致未对齐指针，这是由于编译时启用了-Werror选项，将警告当作错误处理；三是创建GLEX区域时内存资源不足，多次出现“no enough memory resources”的错误提示。针对这些问题，可按以下步骤解决：    1. 检查内存资源：当出现“GLEX create region failed: no enough memory resources”错误时，先使用free -h命令查看系统内存使用情况，确认是否有足够的内存资源。若内存不足，可关闭其他不必要的进程释放内存，或调整作业申请的内存量，在yhrun命令中添加mem=XXGB参数限制内存使用。    2. 处理编译报错：若UCX编译时因结构体对齐问题报错，可在configure后，编辑ucx目录下src/uct/glex/Makefile文件，删除其中的-Werror选项。    3. 排查I/O和缓冲区问题：对于注册用户缓冲区数据类型时的I/O错误，使用dmesg | grep disk命令检查磁盘I/O错误日志，查看是否有磁盘故障或读写异常。同时，检查相关文件系统的状态，如Lustre存储是否正常，可参考之前的Lustre存储故障处理步骤，挂起对应分区作业、查询日志并重启相关节点。    4. 更新UCX版本或配置：若上述方法无效，可尝试更新UCX到最新版本，或检查UCX的配置参数是否正确。例如，确认UCXTLS环境变量的设置是否合适，可设置为*export UCXTLS=sm,tcp,glex以启用多种传输层。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is relevant because it directly addresses how to view system task information for TH-eX, but could be improved by providing more specific steps or examples., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score is 0.5 because some parts of the actual output contradict the retrieval context while others are consistent. Specifically, there is a contradiction regarding the command to view job list (claim mentions 'yhq' but retrieval says use 'jhfs quota -g groupname /fs2' for disk usage and no mention of yhq), another contradiction about the meaning of CG state which isn't explained in the context, while one part was consistent due to a likely typo. The overall score reflects these mixed inconsistencies., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.00 because all the retrieved nodes are relevant to the input query, and there are no irrelevant nodes present in this retrieval., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.671875, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about viewing system task information because it primarily focuses on job submission methods and resource allocation in TH-eX systems, mentioning commands like yhrun and yhbatch for submitting jobs. While there are statements that mention checking or viewing job status (e.g., '用户可以通过相关命令查看分区、结点和作业状态' and '用户即可以看到该作业十分详细的信息'), the specific method to view task information is not clearly described in the context, making it less directly relevant., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Recall (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The expected output mentions commands like yhq, yhinfo, and yhi which are not present in the retrieval context. The retrieval context does not contain any information about these specific commands or their usage., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何查看TH-eX的系统任务信息？
  - actual output: 查看TH-eX的系统任务信息可以通过以下几种方式：1. 使用yhq命令查看作业状态，用户可以通过该命令获取自己提交的作业信息，包括作业ID（jobid）和作业状态。如果作业长时间处于CG状态，表示作业没有正常退出，系统管理员会定期处理；如果变为$状态，表示系统维护中，完成后恢复。2. 使用yhinfo或yhi命令查看节点状态，用户可以了解各个节点的使用情况，包括分区、可用状态、最大运行时间限制和节点数量等信息。3. 通过查看作业明细命令来获取详细信息，用户可以根据作业ID（jobid）查看特定作业的详细信息，包括作业的执行情况和状态变化。此外，还可以通过查看系统提供的相关文档和手册，了解更多的命令和参数选项，以便更有效地管理和监控任务。


  - expected output: 用户可使用yhq命令查看自己提交的作业，还能通过yhinfo或yhi命令查看结点使用情况，使用yhcancel命令取消任务，且作业有不同状态及对应的含义。具体查看方法如下：    1. 查看作业状态：使用yhq命令可查看自己提交的作业，若要查看作业明细，可通过yhq jobid命令，其中jobid为作业的记号。    2. 查看结点状态：yhinfo或yhi为查看结点使用情况的命令，使用yhi -l可获得结点更为详细的信息。    3. 查看分区信息：使用yhcontrol show partition partition_name可查看相应分区的详细信息，使用yhacctmgr list association可查看自己账号的权限设置。    4. 查看磁盘配额：使用lfs quota -g groupname /fs2或lfs quota -u username /fs2查看配额信息。

TH-eX 系统用户手册业，用户可以在脚本中提交多个任务，逐个计算。如前所述，系统中作业的运行分成两步:资源分配与任务加载。批处理作业使用 yhbatch 提交脚本的方式运行，yhbatch 负责资源分配，yhbatch 获取资源后，会在获取资源的第一个结点运行提交的脚本。3.3.1.1 MPI 并行作业举例一:假设用户可执行文件为 aout，需使用 112 个进程并行计算，编写提交脚本sub.sh 如下:使用批处理命令进行作业提交:计算过程中，脚本所在的工作目录中默认会生成以 slurm 开头的.out SCF, DF幕输出的信息会保存到该文件中。注意:yhbatch 申请的资源应当不小于 sub.sh 脚本中 yhrun 申请的资源。3.3.1.2 OpenMP 并行作业OpenMP 文持共享式内存并行，因此单纯的 OpenMP 多线程并行程序只能在单计算结点上运行。由于每个计算结点是 56 个处理器核心数，因此最大线程数设置不能超过 56.如果用户的程序文持该并行方式，知用户可执行文件为aout，需使用 56 个OpenMP 多线程并行计算。编写提交脚本 sub.sh 如下:\n*REIZate TH-eX 系统用户手册提交批处理命令如下:3.3.1.3 MPI+', '不需要交互，则需使用批处理作业提交方式。3. yhrun 提交的任务，如果没有进行输入输出的重定向，在关闭登陆客户端软件时，会导致任务中断，因此如无特殊需要，在直接使用 yhrun 提交任务时，重定向输入输出，并保留相应的 log 文件，方便遇到问题时，技术人员及时解决。重定向举例如下:>为重定癌符号，2>人1 表示标准错误输出重定癌至标准输出，最后的信表示后台提区方式，这样保证了该任务在登陆客户端关闭时依然保持不中断。4. 再次提示，如无特殊需要请使用批处理作业 yhbatch 提交方式，yhbatch 提交的作业终端关闭后不会受到影响。3.3.3 应用软件作业提交举例3.3.3.1 应用软件 LAMMPS 使用1) 在登陆节点命令行下加载 LAMMPS 所需环境变量:31\n*[了te TH-eX 系统用户手册说明:从 lammps 的版本名称 lammps/24Mar22-icc19.0-mpich-x 可以看出:> 它的版本号是 24Mar22，即 2022-03-24 发布的版本。用户可以依据需求更换其他版本。> ‘EATER ana Intel 19.0.4 和 mpich-x ，相关的 module 环境已被 lammps 模块自动加载。2) 编写任务脚本 sub.sh 如下:> 第一行: 它是一个用/bin/sh 来解析的脚本文件。> FAT: -N 2 表示 2 个节点; -mn112 Ratt 112 cpu 核， Imp_ mpi 是可执行程序的名字;in.test 是输入文件名。kasatat于=pA>oy|pa+aywR3.3.3.2 应用软件 GROMACS 使用1) 在登陆节点命令行下加载 GROMACS 所需环境变量:2) 编写任务脚本 sub.sh 如下:说明:> ”第二行: 用 gmx mpi grompp 进行前期处理。> B=: 用 gmx mpi mdrun 来计算，-ntomp 1 表示每个 mpi 进程局用一个 openmp 线程。> “用户根据自己的需求将相关的 gmx 处理命令写入 sub.sh 脚本即可。\n*REXESrr', '方式，知用户可执行文件为aout，需使用 56 个OpenMP 多线程并行计算。编写提交脚本 sub.sh 如下:\n*REIZate TH-eX 系统用户手册提交批处理命令如下:3.3.1.3 MPI+OpenMP 并行作业如果用户的程序文持该并行方式，各用户可执行文件为aout，需使用 14 个进程并行计算，每个进程下开启 8 个 OpenMP 线程，则应使用的计算结点数为14*8/56=2. 2m Herc HAAS sub.sh 如下:加载环境变量，并提交批处理命令:注意: TH-EX 系统上的资源使用抢占式调度方式，即作业在结点上哪怕内运行了一个核的进程，其他作业也无法再分配到该结点上。特别提示:批处理作业提交模式，使用范围很广，由于手册篇幅限制，不能详述，如果您在提交批处理作业的过程中遇到了任何问题，请联系中心技术人员。3.3.2 交互式作业提交 yhrun对于交互式作业，资源分配与任务加载两步均通过 yhrun 命令进行: 当在登录 shell 中执行 yhrun 命令时，yhzrun 首先向系统提交作业请求并等待资源分配，然后在所分配的结点上加载作业任务。yhrun 运行的主要格式如下:yhrun [options] program\nNSz TH-eX 系统用户手册yhrun 包括多个选项，与 yhbatch 类似。示例:1) 在分区 ep4，使用两个结点上运行 hostname$ yhrun -N 2 -n 112 -p cp4 hostnameyhrun: job 4385 queued and waiting for resourcesyhrun: job 4385 has been allocated resourcescn4cn4cn5特别注意:1. yhrun 基本可以蔡代 mpirun，使用 1.3.2 章节推荐的系统自带的 mpi SES译的程序，完全可以使用 ynhrun 提交任务，而不需使用 mpirun.2. yhrun 为交互式作业提交方式，用户如需要和程序进行交互，则选择直接使用 yhrun 提交任务，如果不需要交互，则需使用批处理作业提交方式。3. yhrun 提交的任务，如果没有进行输入输出的重定向，在关闭登陆客户端软件时，会导致任务中断，因此如无特殊需要，在直接使用', "用户登录后会出现如图 3-1 的磁盘配额信息:Filesystem used quota Limit grace files quota kimt = grace/fs2 3616 045126 1T - 13942 1999966 2000000图 3-1 磁盘配额登陆提示信息22\nPr TH-eX 系统用户手册表 3-2 磁盘配额各关键词说明5 ee >| Rhesystem |用户所在的共享分布式存储it | rEpiles |用疡已有的文伯数量 (单位: 个)it | 文件数量硬限制 〈单位: 个)以磁盘存储为例说明软、硬限制的含义，文件数软、硬限制的含义与其一样。用户使用存储低于 512G 时，如图 3-1 所示，存储状态正常，当用户使用存储介于512G 和 1T 之间时，存储状态如图 3-2 所示，kbytes 参数对应的数字带有“*”表示用户配额异营，“6d23h59m57Ss”表示一个月的倒计时，如果用户在倒计时结束前将使用存储清理到 512G 以下，则存储状态恢复正常。和否则用户的数据量超出软限制且超出倒计时，如图 3-3 所示。如果用户数据在倒计时期间继续增长，超出硬限制，则用户存储将无法写入，如图 3-4 Stax; 数据操作也会受限制，如图 3-5 所人小。Filesystem used quota Limit grace files quota Ltntt grace/Ts2 728G* 5126 iT 6d23h59m57s =Filesystem used quota Limit grace files quota Limtt grace/Ts2 728G* 5126 iT 438942 =Filesystem used quota limit files quota limit = grace/fs2 1.237 ;23\nNSC[nscctj@th-ex-1n0] $ cp test.txt test2.txtcp:writing './test2.txt':Disk quota exceededcp:writing './test2.txt':Input/Output3-5 用户数据超出磁盘配额限制的状态提示VY. wt(EIS:有的时候用户登录会出现错误提示“Some errors happened when getting quotainfo.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly relevant to the user's query about troubleshooting SSH connectivity issues with an Elasticsearch system. It focuses more on general Linux server management and network configuration, which are related but not specific enough for this context., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.40 indicates that there are some inaccuracies or deviations in the actual output compared to the retrieval context, though it is still somewhat aligned., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.0 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant ones, so the retrieval contexts have perfectly placed the most relevant information first., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it discusses unrelated topics like Einstein's achievements and provides troubleshooting steps for a different issue (library path issues in HPC environments) that does not directly address SSH connection problems. The relevant statements mention library conflicts but do not provide specific steps to resolve SSH connectivity errors, focusing instead on environment variables and module loading which are tangentially related at best., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.67 because it reflects a moderate alignment between the expected output and the retrieval context, with three out of five sentences finding support from the provided nodes while one sentence does not align well., error: None)

  - input: 如何排查ES系统 ssh 不上计算节点的原因，给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 排查ES系统ssh不上计算节点的原因，可以按照以下步骤进行：1. 检查是否由于环境变量导致的库路径问题，例如LD_LIBRARY_PATH被修改，使得ssh动态链接了非系统库，如Anaconda中的库，可以通过ldd命令检查ssh依赖的库路径，确认是否来自非系统目录；2. 检查计算节点是否缺少必要的共享库，例如libx11.so等，如果登录节点有而计算节点没有，需要将相关库文件拷贝到共享存储，并在加载脚本中添加环境变量LD_LIBRARY_PATH，确保计算节点能正确加载库路径；3. 确认计算节点是否安装了所需的shell环境，例如ksh，若系统未安装或未正确配置，需通过yum安装并设置默认shell，同时检查脚本中的shebang是否正确指向ksh，避免因路径问题导致无法执行。


  - expected output: 要排查ES系统ssh不上计算节点的原因，可按以下具体步骤进行：    1. 查看ssh报错信息，如用户遇到的“ssh: symbol lookup error: ssh: undefined symbol: EVP_KDF_ctrl, version OPENSSL_1_1_1b”，此报错是因加载Anaconda环境修改了LD_LIBRARY_PATH，使ssh动态链接了Anaconda中的库而非系统库。通过执行ldd /usr/bin/ssh命令，可查看ssh依赖的库文件路径，若显示来自非系统库路径（如Anaconda路径），则确定是环境变量问题。    2. 检查环境变量配置，查看~/.bashrc或~/.bash_profile等文件中是否有修改LD_LIBRARY_PATH的语句，特别是指向Anaconda等非系统库的路径。若有，注释或删除相关语句，然后执行source ~/.bashrc刷新环境变量，确保ssh使用系统标准库。    3. 检查计算节点的库文件是否缺失。例如TH-HPC集群计算节点缺少libx11.so库，可将登录节点的相关库文件（如libX11.so.6、libXau.so.6、libxcb.so.1）拷贝到共享存储目录，并在加载脚本中添加环境变量LD_LIBRARY_PATH。    4. 检查计算节点的网络连接是否正常，可通过ping命令测试登录节点与计算节点之间的网络连通性。同时，查看计算节点的ssh服务是否正常运行，执行systemctl status sshd命令查看ssh服务状态，若未运行，执行systemctl start sshd启动服务。    5. 检查用户权限和shell配置，如TH-HPC4系统使用ksh需加载module add loginnode，确保用户有正确的shell权限和配置，可通过echo $SHELL查看当前shell，必要时使用chsh -s /bin/ksh 用户名修改默认shell。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.67 indicates that there are some inconsistencies between the actual output and the retrieval context, but they are not directly stated as contradictions in the provided information., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7416666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.74 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes ranked 3, 5, and 8) that support the user's query about applying for a 1TB reservation queue by mentioning resource allocation or job submission with resources, but two of them (node ranks 2 and 6) explicitly mention methods to apply for additional resources. However, there are three irrelevant nodes (ranks 1,4,7) which discuss unrelated topics like node status commands or rsync automation that detract from the precision., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly answering how to deploy ParaFold 2.0 in HPC4 public directory, but it provides a general overview of deploying AI models on high-performance computing clusters which may be relevant., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieval context in several ways: it mentions deploying ParaFold to a specific directory (HPC4) and cloning from GitHub which is not mentioned; it specifies creating a conda environment with Python 3.8, but the context doesn't mention conda or any version requirement; it advises against using higher than Python 3.8 when the context does not provide such advice; and it states that CUDA toolkit must be installed manually while the context lacks any reference to installation steps for CUDA., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8541666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1 because all retrieval contexts are relevant and ranked appropriately., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.375, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on general installation instructions for computational tools (like Conda environments, package installations) but does not specifically address the deployment of ParaFold 2.0 on HPC4 public directory as mentioned in the input query. The relevant statements are about deploying ColabFold or other software and mention CPU/GPU settings, but do not directly answer how to deploy ParaFold 2.0 on HPC4., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.7142857142857143, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.71 indicates that most aspects are covered, but some details like parameter adjustments might require additional verification., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly relevant to the question about checking HPC4's gn33 node. It provides a general explanation of what an HPC cluster is and how it works, which may be related but does not specifically address the user's query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.67 indicates that there was a minor contradiction between the actual output and retrieval context, but it's not clear what exactly caused this low score., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked first, and there are no irrelevant nodes that should be above them., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6764705882352942, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it contains information about Einstein and VASP performance testing on HPC systems, but does not specifically address how to check the status or configuration of the gn33 node. The relevant statements include mentions of checking device permissions and using specific commands like `inm_check_status` for chip-related issues, which are related to hardware monitoring rather than the specific inquiry about the 'gn33' node., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.0 because all sentences from the expected output are fully supported by corresponding nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring a perfect match., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何检查HPC4系统的gn33节点？
  - actual output: 检查HPC4系统的gn33节点需要结合系统测试和状态检测方法，主要包括寄存器检查、芯片状态验证、网络和存储测试以及任务执行情况分析。1. 使用命令`inm_check_status`或`inm_check_err`检查芯片状态寄存器，确保寄存器值与文档中的默认值一致，发现异常时需记录并处理。2. 通过`dump_hnr_llp_staus`命令查看PCB板状态，输入参数如P000AM1/S00A00/Z0C0CPM0等，确认PCB板整体运行状态是否正常。3. 检查DSP设备权限，进入指定目录使用`./check_device`脚本验证节点，确保节点无异构核问题，例如THCP4、THMT1等节点可能存在异构核情况。4. 在MN7上运行Linpack测试，使用16个FT核，内存64GB，提交任务命令为`./sub.sh $nodelist $reservation $logdir`，确保结果达到约100Gflops，并检查残差是否通过。5. 查看测试日志，确认任务是否成功完成，是否存在失败或跳过的情况，同时注意18-19机柜无需跑Linpack，仅需进行网络测试和存储挂载。6. 调整并行参数如NPAR=4和KPAR=2，优化性能，对比不同核数（如56核和64核）的运行时间，确保gn33节点在不同模式下的性能表现符合预期。7. 根据提供的寄存器地址和值，检查共享信用使用寄存器、HP_CREDIT相关寄存器等，确保数值正确，避免因寄存器错误导致系统异常。

  - expected output: 数据库内相关内容主要涉及芯片状态检查、PCB板状态查看、Linpack测试及VASP性能测试等。其中，检查芯片状态可使用inm_check_status命令，如./inm_check_status -t zni -o 118017 -m ALL，能读取芯片状态寄存器并与默认值比较；查看PCB板状态可用dump_hnr_llp_staus命令，例如./dump_hnr_llp_staus P000AM1；测试节点计算性能可通过Linpack测试，在mn7上使用./sub.sh $nodelist $reservation $logdir提交任务，还可使用check_device脚本检查DSP设备权限。根据经验，要检查HPC4系统的gn33节点，可按以下步骤进行：    1. 登录目标节点：使用ssh gn33命令登录到HPC4系统的gn33节点，确保网络连接正常。    2. 检查节点基本状态：通过top或htop命令查看节点的CPU、内存使用情况，了解系统负载；使用df -h查看磁盘空间占用，确保存储资源充足；使用free -h查看内存使用情况，包括物理内存和交换空间。    3. 检查网络连接：使用ping命令测试节点与其他节点的网络连通性，如ping mn7；使用ifconfig或ip addr查看网络接口状态，确保网络接口正常工作。    4. 检查芯片状态：使用inm_check_status命令检查节点芯片状态，例如inm_check_status -t zni -o 芯片编号 -m ALL，读取芯片状态寄存器并与默认值对比，判断芯片是否正常。    5. 查看PCB板状态：使用dump_hnr_llp_staus命令查看节点所在PCB板的状态，如dump_hnr_llp_staus  PCB板名称，了解PCB板的整体状况。    6. 测试计算性能：进行Linpack测试评估节点计算能力，进入/root/tools/linpack/ft_linpack_64GB目录，使用./sub.sh $nodelist $reservation $logdir提交测试任务，查看结果是否达到预期的Gflops值。    7. 检查设备权限：使用check_device脚本检查DSP等设备的权限，确保设备可正常使用，如check_device gn33。    8. 查看系统日志：通过tail -f /var/log/messages或journalctl查看系统日志，查找是否有异常错误信息，帮助定位潜在问题。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.67 because the actual output provided instructions for adding nodes to a network partition, which partially addresses the user's query about adding nodes to the 'qixiang' partition in the 'hpc2' system. However, it does not specifically mention or address the 'qixiang account' part of the question, and there are irrelevant statements that discuss general node management without focusing on the specific account mentioned by the user., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5714285714285714, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score is 0.57 because the actual output contradicts the retrieval context in two ways: (1) The claim states that there are configuration registers totaling 192 bits for 16 partition items, but the retrieval context clarifies that these are multiple registers summing to 192 bits rather than a single register of 192 bits. (2) Additionally, while the claim mentions copying modified files and scripts to complete configuration, this action isn't explicitly described in the retrieval context; however, since it doesn't directly contradict any stated fact about location or necessity, I will not consider it as contradiction., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 1.0 indicates that all retrieved contexts are relevant, as there were no nodes with verdict 'no'. The first two nodes provide detailed instructions on configuring partition masks for nodes in the HPC system., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.7857142857142857, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it contains information about ZFS storage configuration and Einstein's Nobel Prize, which are unrelated topics. The query asks about adding nodes to an HPC2 system's qixiang partition, while the retrieved content discusses network partitioning for storage systems or data centers and Einstein's achievements., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because although there is some mention of network partitioning and HBA card configuration, these are not directly tied to the specific task described in the expected output which involves configuring nodes for a 'qixiang' partition on an hpc2 system., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何为hpc2系统的qixiang账户的qixiang分区添加节点？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，为hpc2系统的qixiang账户的qixiang分区添加节点需要遵循以下步骤：1. 分区配置方面，网络分区功能通过配置不同的partition_key实现节点隔离，使用192位寄存器存储16项分区信息，每个VP通过4位索引值进行访问。分区最小单位为一块cpm板的8个节点。对于已正常运行的节点，可以通过脚本对节点进行隔离或关闭分区，例如使用/home/test641/tfq/shelltools_zni下的脚本set_nodes_partition.sh和close_nodes_partition.sh。对于未启动的节点，需修改配置文件并集成到启动镜像中，具体操作包括修改zninet_cpm文件中的相关参数，并将修改后的文件和脚本复制到指定目录。2. 在服务器分区配置中，需确保覆盖大部分节点以实现有效隔离，同时注意分区信息索引配置寄存器的设置。3. 由于提供的资料中没有直接提到qixiang账户或qixiang分区的具体配置细节，因此无法提供更具体的步骤，建议参考上述通用方法并结合系统管理员的指导进行操作。


  - expected output: 数据库内相关内容主要涉及网络分区配置、HBA卡配置、vdevid.conf生成等，其中网络分区配置提到通过脚本对已启动节点配置partitionmask实现隔离，对未启动节点修改配置文件并集成到启动镜像中，服务器分区需覆盖大部分节点；HBA卡配置涉及获取PCI ID、配置端口别名等；vdev工具用于生成vdev_id.conf配置文件。根据经验，为hpc2系统qixiang账户的qixiang分区添加节点，可参考以下步骤：    1. 确定添加节点的范围和需求：明确需要添加到qixiang分区的节点编号及数量，了解这些节点的硬件配置和网络连接情况，确保符合分区的要求。    2. 准备配置文件和工具：获取并安装相关配置工具，如文中提到的vdev工具，确保其依赖的python2.7、lsscsi、sg_utils已安装。根据节点信息编写JBOD配置文件，如jbod.json，定义节点与JBOD的对应关系。    3. 配置网络分区：对于已启动的节点，使用/home/test641/tfq/shelltoolszni下的setnodespartition.sh脚本，输入节点列表和partitionmask（如0x801/0x802），实现节点隔离并添加到目标分区。对于未启动或需重启的节点，修改zninetcpm文件中相应节点的配置值，将修改后的zninetcpm和相关脚本交给系统管理员，集成到节点启动镜像中，使分区功能在节点启动时生效。    4. 配置HBA卡和存储连接：获取HBA卡的PCI ID，通过lspci | grep LSI命令查看。根据HBA卡与JBOD的连接关系，在/etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf文件中配置HBA卡的PORT别名，确保CHANNEL NAME正确对应分区的JBOD设备。执行udevadm trigger命令使配置生效，检查/dev/disk/by-vdev下的硬盘数量是否与实际一致。    5. 设置多路径配置：根据硬盘的WWID和别名，在multipath.conf文件中添加多路径映射配置，执行multipath -v2和multipath -v3命令生成映射，检查/dev/mapper下是否生成对应硬盘链接及数量是否正确。    6. 验证节点添加结果：添加节点后，通过系统管理工具或命令查看qixiang分区的节点列表，确认新节点已正确添加。测试节点之间的网络连通性和存储访问情况，确保分区功能正常，节点能够正常工作。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.7142857142857143, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.71 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the retrieval context and the actual output., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score of 0.5 indicates that half of the retrieved nodes are relevant and half are irrelevant. The first node is ranked too low because it does not mention HPC4 or job priority at all. The second node is correct as configuration files can influence job settings, but the third node about deploying multiple programs is unrelated to priority adjustment. The fourth node mentions job scheduling indirectly through AlphaFold2 instructions, which might be relevant if we consider that adjusting priorities often involves job schedulers like Slurm, but it doesn't explicitly address highest priority setting. The fifth node discusses creating a job file without mentioning priority settings., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.3902439024390244, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting job priority on HPC4. The relevant statements provided are unrelated to the topic of job prioritization, focusing instead on running scripts and compilation steps for software execution., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.6 indicates that the expected output is partially supported by the retrieval context, as it covers key steps like checking job status and confirming system priority mechanisms but lacks specific details on how to actually change the priority using commands or tools mentioned in the context (e.g., yhbatch command). The supportive reasons highlight alignment with step 2 and part of step 5 regarding verification, while unsupportive reasons show that there is no direct mention of adjustment methods like yhbatch or specific administrative actions., error: None)

  - input: 如何调整HPC4系统上的作业fu至最高级？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，调整HPC4系统上的作业fu至最高级需要进行以下步骤：1. 修改作业配置文件，包括设置正确的路径和参数，例如在fluent-singularity.sh中调整分区、节点数、cpuspernode、journalfile、cttype及exe等参数，确保作业能够适配计算环境。2. 调整作业提交脚本中的资源分配，如通过yhbatch命令提交任务时指定合适的节点数和GPU卡号，以优化计算资源的使用。3. 确保所有相关文件和依赖项正确配置，例如在运行Fluent-UDF时，需修改user.udf文件中的FLUENT_INC变量路径及CSOURCES，并替换libudf中的C文件，保证编译和运行的正确性。


  - expected output: 在HPC4系统中，若需将作业调整至最高优先级，可参考以下通用思路及步骤：    1. 确认系统优先级机制：联系系统管理员，了解HPC4系统的作业调度策略和优先级设置规则，明确调整作业优先级的具体要求和限制。    2. 查看当前作业状态：使用yhq命令查看需要调整优先级的作业信息，包括作业ID、当前状态等，确保作业处于可调整状态。    3. 申请优先级调整：向系统管理员提交作业优先级调整申请，说明调整原因和需求，如作业的紧急程度、重要性等。    4. 管理员操作调整：若申请通过，管理员可能会使用系统管理工具或命令进行优先级调整。例如，在SLURM调度系统中，管理员可通过scancel -p或scontrol update JobId=作业ID Priority=最高优先级值等命令调整作业优先级，具体命令需根据系统实际配置确定。    5. 验证调整结果：调整后，使用yhq或squeue -j 作业ID命令查看作业优先级是否已更新为最高级，确认作业在调度队列中的位置是否提前。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.9 because the user's question was about how to troubleshoot an invalid SLURM command with specific parameters, but the response provided general advice on checking common issues and contacting administrators without addressing the 'constraint' parameter specifically or providing detailed steps for diagnosing that particular issue., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6363636363636364, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.64 because the actual output contradicts the retrieval context in multiple ways: first, by mentioning troubleshooting for a specific command without providing any details; second, by suggesting to avoid shared file systems like yhbcast when transferring files, which conflicts with the retrieval context that advises against using such systems due to potential performance and security issues. Additionally, it states CPU binding options can be set via environment variables, but the retrieval context does not mention this method., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.5787301587301587, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score of 0.58 indicates that there are both relevant and irrelevant nodes present in the retrieval contexts, but not all retrieved documents are directly relevant to the user's query about troubleshooting sbatch srun with specific options., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.24193548387096775, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant because the input query specifically asks about troubleshooting the 'slurm sbatch srun --mem' command, while the provided statements discuss unrelated topics such as storage quotas, I/O errors due to system maintenance, and program compilation issues. None of these directly address why the '--mem' or '--constraint' options in Slurm commands might be invalid., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5714285714285714, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.57 indicates that the expected output has partial alignment with the retrieval context, covering some aspects but missing others., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何排查slurm sbatch srun --mem --constraint参数命令无效的原因是什么？请给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 排查slurm sbatch srun --mem --constraint参数命令无效的原因，可以按照以下步骤进行：1. 检查参数格式和拼写是否正确，确保没有输入错误或遗漏。2. 确认所使用的slurm版本是否支持这些参数，并查阅相关文档以获取正确的使用方法。3. 查看作业提交后的日志文件，寻找与参数相关的错误信息或警告，这有助于定位问题所在。4. 检查环境变量和配置文件，如.bashrc，确保没有冲突的设置影响参数的执行。5. 验证资源是否可用，例如内存和特定的硬件约束条件是否满足，避免因资源不足导致参数失效。6. 测试其他参数或简化作业脚本，以排除其他因素干扰，确认问题是否仅出现在特定参数上。7. 联系系统管理员或技术支持，提供详细的错误信息和作业配置，以便获得进一步的帮助和解决方案。8. 检查是否有系统维护或网络问题影响作业的正常运行，可能导致参数无法正确应用。9. 确保编译和运行环境一致，避免因环境差异导致参数不生效。10. 使用调试工具如valgrind检查程序是否存在内存泄漏或其他问题，这些问题可能间接影响参数的效果。


  - expected output: 数据库内相关内容主要涉及资源管理系统中SBATCH命令选项及环境变量的介绍，如--mem、--constraint等参数的使用，同时还有作业运行时因内存溢出、MPI版本问题、存储配额超限等导致异常的案例及解决方法。根据经验，排查slurm sbatch srun --mem --constraint参数命令无效的具体操作步骤如下：    1. 检查参数格式与拼写：确认命令中参数格式正确，像--mem=100GB需带单位且用等号连接，--constraint="gpu"约束条件用引号包裹，多条件用逗号分隔，可通过示例命令srun --mem=20GB --constraint="gpu" hostname进行验证。    2. 确认资源调度器配置：利用sinfo -o "%N %c %m %G"查看节点可用资源与约束条件是否匹配，若--constraint指定标签在节点不存在，需联系管理员添加。    3. 检查作业脚本环境变量：在批处理脚本中，通过echo SLURMMEMPERNODE或echo SLURMCONSTRAINTS验证参数是否被正确解析，若环境变量未获取参数值，可能是脚本中参数位置错误。    4. 排查内存参数有效性：查看sinfo确认节点内存，若--mem值超过节点实际容量需调整，注意未指定单位默认为MB，可测试srun -N1 --mem=10GB --pty bash申请单节点内存。    5. 检查约束条件冲突：若--constraint与其他参数冲突，如同时申请--constraint="gpu"和--no-gpus，需调整参数逻辑，并用scancel取消异常作业后重新提交。    6. 查看slurm日志与错误信息：检查/var/log/slurmctld.log，通过grep "Invalid parameter"查看参数解析错误，若提示资源不可用，说明集群无满足条件节点，需等待或调整参数。    7. 验证编译与运行环境：若作业因内存错误终止，编译时添加-g选项，使用valgrind --leak-check=yes ./myprog检查内存泄漏。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because the actual output does not address the user's query at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.8 because while the general idea of setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH for SSH is mentioned, the specific command provided in the claim may not align with all systems and requires checking via 'ldd /usr/bin/ssh' to ensure correctness., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.6416666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.64 indicates that while there are relevant documents available (nodes 2,3,4,7), they are mixed with irrelevant ones (nodes 1 and 5). The positive nodes provide direct instructions on granting SSH access by creating users, configuring PAM and SSH settings, and managing firewalls, which align well. However, the negative nodes discuss unrelated topics like OpenSSL errors or general authentication mechanisms without directly addressing user-specific permissions for 'lisn'. This dilutes the relevance of the relevant documents., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.36363636363636365, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on troubleshooting an OpenSSL-related error in SSH connections and system security configurations, while the user's query specifically asks about granting SSH access permissions for a user named 'lisn'. There is no mention of specific users or permission management in the context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output provides instructions on granting SSH access but lacks explicit reference to the retrieval context node which discusses system security hardening and user management, while also failing to address key aspects like firewall configuration that are present in the context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何为lisn用户开通ssh到服务器节点的权限？
  - actual output: 为lisn用户开通ssh到服务器节点的权限，需要从以下几个方面进行操作：1. 确保环境变量配置正确，避免因Anaconda等第三方库导致的OpenSSL版本冲突，例如在~/.bashrc中添加export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH，以确保ssh使用系统标准库而非第三方库。2. 检查并修改相关配置文件，如/etc/pam.d/sshd或/etc/pam.d/password-auth，配置密码复杂度、密码锁定机制等安全策略，确保用户登录符合系统安全要求。3. 配置欢迎信息和禁止使用su等安全加固措施，例如在Ubuntu系统中通过编辑/etc/update-motd.d/welcome文件设置欢迎信息，在/etc/pam.d/su中添加auth required pam_wheel.so以限制su使用权限。4. 确保用户账户已正确创建，并且具有访问服务器节点的权限，包括正确的SSH密钥或密码配置，以及在系统中没有被锁定或禁用。5. 检查系统日志，如/auth.log或/var/log/sec，确认用户登录过程无异常，并根据需要调整相关服务配置。


  - expected output: 根据经验，为lisn用户开通ssh到服务器节点权限，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 确认用户账号存在：检查系统中是否已有lisn用户，若没有则创建用户，命令为useradd lisn，并设置密码passwd lisn。    2. 添加用户到允许SSH组：将lisn用户添加到ssh登录允许的组，如usermod -aG sshusers lisn，若系统使用wheel组，可执行usermod -aG wheel lisn。    3. 配置SSH服务器允许登录：编辑SSH配置文件vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config，确保PermitRootLogin设置为yes或prohibit-password，确认AllowUsers或AllowGroups中包含lisn用户或所属组，如添加AllowUsers lisn，修改后重启SSH服务systemctl restart sshd。    4. 生成并配置密钥（可选）：若使用密钥登录，在lisn用户目录下生成密钥su - lisn，ssh-keygen，将公钥添加到~/.ssh/authorized_keys，设置文件权限chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys，chmod 700 ~/.ssh。    5. 检查防火墙设置：确保防火墙允许SSH端口（默认22）通信，查看防火墙状态firewall-cmd --state，开放端口firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp，重新加载防火墙firewall-cmd --reload。    6. 验证登录权限：使用lisn用户尝试SSH登录服务器ssh lisn@服务器IP，若提示密码则输入正确密码，若配置密钥则直接登录，查看是否成功。    7. 排查登录问题：若登录失败，查看SSH日志tail -f /var/log/secure，根据错误信息调整配置，如权限问题检查文件和目录权限，密钥问题检查公钥是否正确添加。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because the actual output did not provide any information related to releasing TH-eX nodes, only discussing node failure and job scheduling., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieval context by stating that users may cancel batch processing jobs using 'yhcancel', but the retrieval context only mentions this command in relation to user jobs and does not mention it being applicable to batch jobs., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7736111111111109, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.78 because the retrieval contexts have a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. The first node provides detailed instructions on using yhcancel to release user tasks, so it's highly relevant. The second node reinforces this by explaining task cancellation with yhcancel for releasing nodes. However, there are three 'no' verdicts that appear later in the ranking: the third node discusses Lustre file system configuration without mentioning lisn or node reservation; the fifth and seventh nodes also discuss general Lustre operations unrelated to specific user reservations. This dilutes the relevance as irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than they should be, reducing the score., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about releasing nodes reserved by a specific user 'lisn'. The provided reasons indicate that none of the statements in the context address node release mechanisms or mention any action related to freeing up resources for users with specific usernames. Instead, it focuses on job submission methods (e.g., sbatch, yhrun), installation steps (like installing lsb package), and system configuration parameters unrelated to user-specific node reservation releases., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.8181818181818182, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.82 indicates that the expected output has strong alignment with the retrieval context, covering key steps for task cancellation and resource management in TH-eX system., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何释放TH-eX被用户lisn预约的节点？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，TH-eX系统中释放被用户预约的节点主要涉及任务取消和资源管理相关操作，具体步骤如下：1. 使用yhcancel命令取消用户运行的任务，通过该命令可以强制终止指定作业ID的任务，从而释放被占用的节点资源，作业ID可以通过yhq命令查看；2. 在提交任务时，若使用交互式作业提交方式（如yhrun），需注意输入输出重定向，避免因关闭客户端导致任务中断，从而确保节点资源能够正常释放；3. 对于批处理作业提交方式（如sbatch），任务在后台运行，即使终端关闭也不会影响任务执行，但若需要提前终止任务，仍需使用yhcancel命令，确保节点资源及时释放。此外，若遇到计算节点问题，可尝试安装lsb包或在脚本中添加srun pty参数，以解决节点无法启动或运行失败的问题，从而间接释放节点资源。


  - expected output: 任务取消使用yhcancel命令，根据经验，释放TH-eX被用户lisn预约的节点，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 查看预约节点状态：使用yhq或yhi命令查看当前系统中节点的占用和预约情况，确定哪些节点被用户lisn预约，命令如yhi -l可获取节点详细信息。    2. 确认预约作业信息：通过yhq命令查看用户lisn的作业列表，找到对应的预约作业ID及状态，命令为yhq -u lisn。    3. 取消预约作业：若预约作业尚未开始运行，使用yhcancel命令取消该作业以释放节点，命令格式为yhcancel 作业ID。    4. 强制释放节点（特殊情况）：若作业异常或无法正常取消，联系系统管理员，通过管理员权限强制释放节点，如使用scancel命令取消作业或重置节点状态。    5. 验证节点释放结果：再次使用yhi -l命令查看节点状态，确认被预约节点已释放为可用状态。

  - actual output: TH-HPC3系统shu账户提交作业报Communication connection failure错误，可能涉及多个方面的问题，包括节点问题、网络配置、环境变量设置、资源申请和权限限制等。1. 检查节点状态：首先确认系统存储和网络是否正常，然后检查用户作业是否有其他用户残留进程，有的话需要杀掉这些进程。如果节点有报clocksource错，应将该节点drain掉，并在下次提交时使用-x参数剔除问题节点。2. 网络和通信器问题：根据日志信息，可能存在通信器无效的情况，例如MPI_Topo_test函数调用失败，提示无效的通信器，错误源于空通信器。这种情况下需要联系管理员处理。3. 环境变量和动态库：确保动态链接库路径正确设置，用户需要将动态库的路径添加到环境变量中，如LD_LIBRARY_PATH。如果计算结点和登录结点的软件环境不同，可能导致找不到动态库。4. 资源申请和权限：检查用户是否有权限使用提交作业时指定的队列，可以通过yhi命令查看可用队列。同时，确认提交的资源是否超出用户的资源限制，如时间、核数或内存。5. 提交方式：建议使用yhbatch提交作业，这种方式更稳定，终端关闭或登录节点宕机不会影响任务运行。6. 日志分析：查看slurm日志中的具体错误信息，如“yhrun: error: Task launch for 2440965.0 failed on node cn2892: Job credential expired”或“bus error”，这些信息有助于定位问题根源。7. 联系管理员：如果上述步骤无法解决问题，应联系系统管理员进行进一步排查和处理。


  - expected output: TH-HPC系统作业报Communication connection failure错误可能由多种原因导致。例如，作业断开时slurm日志出现“Job credential expired”是计算结点时间未与管理结点同步；MPI运行错误如“progress engine failure”可能由网络或节点问题引起；作业处于PD状态是因调度策略需等待；提交作业提示权限问题需检查队列和资源限制等。综合来看，可从以下方面排查shu账户提交作业报Communication connection failure的错误：    1. 检查网络连接状态：使用ping命令测试登录节点与计算节点之间的网络连通性，如ping cn2984，查看是否有丢包或延迟过高的情况。若网络不通，联系网络管理员检查网络设备和线路。    2. 查看作业调度状态：通过yhq命令查看作业状态，若作业处于PD状态，说明因调度策略在排队，需耐心等待；若状态为“S”，表示被管理员挂起，等待处理恢复。    3. 验证节点时间同步：登录计算节点，使用date命令查看时间，与管理节点时间对比，若不同步，提交作业时加-x剔除问题结点，并联系管理员同步时间。    4. 排查MPI运行错误：若slurm日志提示MPI相关错误如“progress engine failure”，可能是网络或节点故障，联系管理员检查MPI环境和节点状态。    5. 检查权限和资源限制：提交作业提示权限问题时，使用yhi命令检查可使用的队列，确认是否有权限使用指定分区，以及申请的资源是否超过限制。    6. 查看动态库依赖：若提示动态库缺失，使用locate命令找到库地址，如locate libXXX.so，将路径添加到~/.bashrc文件中，执行source ~/.bashrc生效。    7. 剔除问题节点：若确定某节点存在问题，提交作业时添加-x参数剔除该节点，如yhbatch -x cn2984 -p partition ./sub.sh。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly relevant to the user's question about installing G6K-GPU-Tensor. It provides a general introduction and explanation of what G6K is, but does not address the specific installation steps requested., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.16666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is low because there are several contradictions: dependency installation method (mirror vs default), CUDA version mismatch (11.8 vs unspecified/12.0), compilation command difference ('python setup.py build_ext' vs CMake with flags), and test command omission of options., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7555555555555555, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.76 because there are two nodes with verdict 'yes' and three nodes with verdict 'no', resulting in a precision of (2/5) = 0.4, but the score is not simply based on count alone; it considers the ranking. The first node has a positive verdict and provides direct instructions for installing G6K-GPU-Tensor using CUDA. The second node discusses unrelated software installation. The third node gives relevant dependency information. The fourth node describes testing commands which are tangentially related but not directly about installation steps. The fifth node is irrelevant as it talks about another software's installation, so the score reflects a mix of relevance and ranking issues., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.52, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query because it focuses on installing SPECFEM3D-GPU and AlTar, which are different software packages. The specific steps for G6K-GPU-Tensor installation are not mentioned in the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.7142857142857143, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 0.71 indicates that most steps are covered but some details like the specific CUDA version and compilation options might not be fully aligned with the retrieved content, so it's a good but not perfect match., error: None)

It covers common causes like memory access violations, data type mismelssages, array indexing issues, etc., and offers specific solutions for each potential cause., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieval context by mentioning a Bus error specifically related to the TH-E system while the retrieval context does not mention any such issue and instead focuses on an error in the FT3000 system., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.9240362811791382, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.92 because there are multiple 'yes' nodes that provide highly relevant advice on resource management issues like memory allocation and core count adjustments, which align with the input's focus on troubleshooting Bus error in a high-performance computing environment (likely TH-EX or similar). However, two 'no' nodes exist: one about incomplete documents without solutions for Bus errors, and another regarding an unrelated error message fragment. These 'no' nodes are irrelevant to the specific issue of Bus error troubleshooting, reducing the score from 1 due to their irrelevance despite most contexts being relevant., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.7297297297297297, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant because it focuses on computational errors and system resource management issues related to running jobs, while the input question pertains to Albert Einstein's achievements. Although there are some mentions of similar terms like 'Einstein' and 'Nobel Prize', they do not pertain to his actual scientific contributions but rather appear in a context about computing systems or are incorrect (e.g., mentioning the Nobel Prize year incorrectly). The relevant statements include one that states Einstein won the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect, which is correct historically, but it does not address the specific issue of job errors on TH-eX system. Moreover, other parts mention unrelated topics like a cat and irrelevant technical details about undefined references in code compilation., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.50 because there are some relevant points that align with the expected output but not all aspects are fully supported by the retrieved information., error: None)

  - input: 如何排查TH-eX上运行作业报 Bus error的错误？
  - actual output: TH-eX系统运行作业时出现Bus error错误，可能由多种原因引起，根据提供的内容可以总结出以下排查方法：1. 检查脚本执行方式是否导致任务提前结束，例如在使用后台执行命令时，yhrun任务可能在脚本结束后提前回收节点，需移除最后一个命令的&符号或完善脚本监控所有进程结束再退出；2. 检查程序是否因资源不足或内存分配不当导致异常，例如在TH-3F系统中，作业提交时可能出现“Requested nodes are busy”错误，可通过减少核数、限制内存使用或使用mpi-n编译的程序来解决；3. 检查编译和链接过程中是否存在库依赖问题，例如在FT3000系统编译CESM2.1.3时，缺少LAPACK库函数引用可能导致错误，需在构建命令中添加相关库路径及链接参数。


  - expected output: 要排查TH-eX上运行作业报Bus error的错误，具体排查步骤如下：    1. 检查硬件连接与状态：查看GPU、内存等硬件是否连接松动或存在故障，可尝试重启节点或更换硬件设备。    2. 确认内存使用情况：使用free -h命令查看系统内存使用情况，若内存不足，调整作业申请的内存量，在yhrun命令中添加mem=XXGB参数。    3. 优化作业脚本：检查脚本中是否存在后台执行命令导致节点提前回收的情况，如TH-ES系统案例，移除脚本中最后一行的&符号，或完善脚本监控所有进程结束再退出。    4. 调整资源分配：参考TH-3F系统案例，若使用64核作业存在问题，尝试将核数改为56核，减少资源占用。    5. 检查编译与运行环境：确保程序编译时的环境与运行时一致，避免因AVX支持等问题导致错误，必要时移除-xHOST/-xAVX等优化选项。    6. 查看系统日志：通过tail -f /var/log/messages等命令查看系统日志，获取更多错误细节，辅助定位问题。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8571428571428571, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not address how to handle or manage drain nodes (fn2) specifically. It discusses general concepts of drains and node management, but fails to provide specific steps for the fn2 node., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8333333333333334, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieval context in that it suggests running a script to clear dmesg logs, while the retrieval context indicates that clearing is done with commands like 'yhi -R' or 'ccst'. Additionally, there might be confusion between clearing and checking status., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: Both retrieval contexts are relevant because they both directly address handling drain nodes with detailed steps. The first context explains using commands to get and confirm drain node lists, while the second provides additional details on identifying reasons, cleaning dmesg logs, and verifying connectivity., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5757575757575758, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not highly relevant to the user's question about handling drain nodes because it focuses on unrelated topics like clearing dmesg, using specific software modules (BoltzTrap2), and job scheduling commands in HPC environments, while only mentioning 'drain' in a few instances that do not directly address how to handle or manage drain nodes. The relevant statements are limited to identifying the state of nodes but lack detailed steps for handling them., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because there are some similarities but not all points are covered., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何处理drain的fn2节点，给出具体步骤？
  - actual output: 处理drain的fn2节点需要按照以下步骤进行：1. 通过命令查询特定原因导致的drain节点列表并确认正常节点；2. 清除节点的dmesg信息；3. 检查节点间的网络连通性。具体步骤如下：1. 通过命令yhi –R | grep [reason]获取drain节点列表，例如Hold_on_0531，并使用yhi –n $drain_nodelist –p ALL确认其中的正常开机节点列表；2. 在管理节点进入指定目录，如/home/test641/1903.alltoall_test，运行脚本./zni_clean_dmesg_inband.sh并传入节点列表以清除dmesg信息；3. 使用ccst [机框号]查看机框节点列表，确保节点间的网络连通性正常。


  - expected output: 通过yhi -R | grep 原因获取drain节点列表，再用yhi -n 节点列表 -p ALL确认正常开机节点，还可清除节点dmesg信息及检查节点间pping。具体处理步骤如下：    1. 确认drain原因与节点列表：在管理节点执行yhi -R | grep drain原因（如yhi -R | grep Hold_on_0531），获取被drain的节点列表$drain_nodelist。    2. 筛选正常开机节点：使用yhi -n $drain_nodelist -p ALL命令，从drain节点中筛选出实际正常开机的节点列表$nodelist。    3. 清除节点dmesg信息：进入/home/test641/1903-networkmanager-1.0/loop_alltoall_test目录，执行./zni_clean_dmesg_inband.sh $nodelist，清除正常开机节点的dmesg信息。    4. 检查节点间网络连通性：在同一目录下，使用./zni_check_pping_相关脚本，对$nodelist中的节点进行网络连通性检查，确保节点间通信正常。    5. 解除节点drain状态：若确认节点无硬件故障且网络正常，通过管理工具或命令解除节点的drain状态，例如使用scontrol update NodeName=fn2 State=idle（具体命令需根据系统实际情况调整）。    6. 验证节点状态：执行yhi或sinfo命令，查看fn2节点状态是否恢复为idle或up，确认处理成功。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because the answer provided does not directly address all aspects of querying for job error messages on TH-eX. It mentions general job status and system logs, which are related but not specific to error retrieval during execution. The user specifically asked about querying error information once a job fails, so while there's some relevance, it doesn't fully meet the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the actual output and the retrieval context, but they are not explicitly detailed here., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8083333333333332, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.81 because there are three 'yes' nodes and two 'no' nodes among the top eight contexts, with the first node being highly relevant (directly explaining query methods), second node also directly relevant for job management instructions, fourth node provides direct information on error messages in output files, sixth node explains handling stuck jobs. The seventh node is less relevant as it focuses on submitting options rather than querying errors, and eighth node addresses a specific error fix not related to general querying. However, the score isn't higher because there are two 'no' nodes that don't directly address querying job error messages but still appear in top positions due to similarity., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.3404255319148936, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on job submission and system operations, not querying error messages or Einstein-related topics., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because the expected output provides general guidance on querying job status and handling errors through various commands and logs, while the retrieval context includes information about modifying temporary directories and OpenMP configurations, which partially supports some aspects but does not cover all specific error scenarios mentioned., error: None)

  - input: 如何在TH-eX上查询作业报错信息？
  - actual output: 在TH-eX系统上查询作业报错信息可以通过以下方式实现：1. 通过jobid查看作业详细信息，若作业长时间处于CG状态表示未正常退出，系统管理员会定期处理；若变为$状态表示系统维护中。2. 使用yhq命令查看作业状态和相关信息，通过yhbatch或yhrun提交作业时，需注意资源申请与脚本需求匹配。3. 作业运行过程中生成的输出信息会保存在以slurm开头的.out文件中，用户可检查这些文件获取报错信息。

  - expected output: 在TH-eX上查询作业报错信息，可通过系统提供的工具和作业输出文件获取。作业通过jobid标识，用户可使用yhq命令查看作业明细，作业长时间处于CG状态表示未正常退出，变为$状态表示系统维护中。批处理作业默认生成以slurm开头的.out文件，存储输出信息。具体查询步骤如下：    1. 获取作业ID：使用yhq命令查看当前用户提交的作业列表，获取需要查询的作业ID。    2. 查看作业明细：通过yhq 作业ID命令，查看该作业的详细信息，包括运行状态、节点分配等。    3. 查看作业输出文件：批处理作业在运行过程中会在脚本所在目录生成以slurm开头的.out文件，如slurm-作业ID.out，通过cat或less命令查看该文件，获取报错信息。    4. 查看系统日志：若作业异常终止，可查看系统日志/var/log/slurmctld.log或/var/log/slurmd.log，搜索作业ID获取更详细的错误信息。    5. 检查作业状态：若作业处于CG状态，表示未正常退出，等待系统管理员处理；若为$状态，说明系统维护中，维护完成后作业会恢复。

For test case:

  - input: 如何在TH-eX上为liangyx用户添加 —reservation=x11权限？
  - actual output: 为在TH-eX上为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限，可以按照以下步骤操作：1. 提交mantis申请：用户需要通过提交mantis请求，让管理员为其添加reservation=x11权限，这是访问VNC图形化界面的必要条件。2. 管理员处理申请：管理员收到申请后，会根据系统规则和用户需求进行审核，并在确认无误后为liangyx用户添加相应的权限。3. 用户启动VNC：在权限添加成功后，用户可以通过加载vnc模块并设置密码来启动VNC服务，使用vncserver命令创建图形界面会话，并通过vncviewer连接到计算节点。4. 连接VNC：用户在连接时需填写用户名、IP地址和端口号，并输入之前设置的密码，从而实现对计算节点的图形化访问。5. 注意事项：如果在启动VNC时遇到端口被占用的情况，用户需要切换至其他未被使用的端口，以确保VNC服务正常运行。此外，Windows用户可以通过安装VNC Viewer软件，并利用SSH端口转发功能实现对VNC的访问。


  - expected output: 要在TH-eX上为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限，需通过系统管理流程申请。EX计算节点使用VNC图形化界面时，用户需提交mantis申请，由管理员添加reservation=x11权限。此外，运行FLOW-3D软件时，使用add_user命令为用户添加权限。具体步骤如下：    1. 提交权限申请：通过mantis系统提交申请，说明需要为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限，注明用途（如使用VNC图形界面）。    2. 管理员审核与添加：管理员收到申请后，使用系统管理工具为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限。若涉及特定软件权限（如FLOW-3D），可参考add_user命令格式，由管理员执行类似add_user flow3d liangyx 支持专员用户名的操作。    3. 验证权限生效：用户登录系统后，尝试启动需要—reservation=x11权限的功能（如VNC），执行module load vnc/3.0.3后启动vncserver :1，若能正常设置密码并启动服务，说明权限已生效。完成权限添加后，用户即可在TH-eX系统上使用需要—reservation=x11权限的功能，如通过VNC进行图形化操作。

For test case:

  - input: 如何在Redhat系统的TH-HPC4上为liuyuansharp账户开通 visual 分区和5个节点权限？
  - actual output: 在Redhat系统的TH-HPC4上为liuyuansharp账户开通visual分区和5个节点权限，需要按照以下步骤操作：1. 使用rsync命令将orca503软件从共享目录拷贝到用户目录，并参考sub-orca.sh脚本进行使用；2. 通过添加权限命令为用户配置模块路径，并在.bashrc文件中设置MODULEPATH；3. 使用yhinfo命令查看节点和分区信息，确保正确分配资源。具体步骤如下：1. 登录到TH-HPC4系统并使用rsync命令将orca503软件拷贝到liuyuansharp用户的目录下，例如使用命令`rsync -ltrvP zhenggang4@th-hpc4-ln1:/fs1/software/commerial/orca/orca503 .`，输入相应的账号密码完成拷贝后，参考orca503目录中的sub-orca.sh脚本进行使用；2. 为liuyuansharp账户添加权限，执行命令`add_user orca liuyuansharp 支持专员名字`，然后在用户的.bashrc文件中添加`export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/fs2/home/cfbc34/4c7ffd/modulefiles`，保存后加载模块；3. 使用yhinfo命令查看节点和分区信息，确保visual分区和5个节点的权限已正确配置，例如使用`yhinfo -p visual -n 5`来显示visual分区的5个节点信息。通过以上步骤，可以成功为liuyuansharp账户开通visual分区和5个节点权限。


  - expected output: HPC4的GPU分区配置需通过模块加载和脚本提交作业，配置orca软件时在TH-HPC1~3使用add_user命令添加权限，TH-HPC4则需拷贝软件至用户目录；yhinfo命令可查看节点和分区信息，帮助确认资源状态。具体步骤如下：    1. 确认visual分区存在与权限要求：使用yhinfo -p visual查看visual分区是否存在及权限要求，确认该分区允许的节点数和用户权限限制。    2. 申请权限开通：通过系统管理流程提交申请，说明为liuyuansharp账户开通visual分区及5个节点权限的需求，附使用场景和资源规划。    3. 管理员添加分区权限：管理员登录系统，使用权限管理工具为liuyuansharp账户添加visual分区访问权限，确保账户可提交该分区作业。    4. 配置节点资源配额：管理员通过yhacctmgr命令为账户设置节点资源配额，如yhacctmgr modify liuyuansharp --max-nodes=5 --partition=visual，限制单作业最多使用5个节点。    5. 验证权限与资源：liuyuansharp登录TH-HPC4，执行yhinfo -p visual确认分区可访问，使用yhbatch提交测试作业，如yhbatch -N 5 -p visual test.sh，查看是否成功分配5个节点。

  - input: 如何在TH-eX的/fs2/home/wangrong/software/ABCluster/testfiles/isomer路径下提交脚本sub.sh？
  - actual output: 在TH-eX的/fs2/home/wangrong/software/ABCluster/testfiles/isomer路径下提交脚本sub.sh，可以参考以下步骤：1.确保脚本具有可执行权限，使用chmod +x sub.sh命令添加执行权限。2.直接在终端中运行脚本，输入./sub.sh即可执行。3.如果脚本需要特定的环境变量或模块加载，可以在脚本开头添加相应的设置，例如加载所需的库和模块，确保脚本在正确的环境中运行。


  - expected output: 在TH-eX系统中，要在指定路径下提交脚本，需结合系统作业提交机制与路径操作。如通过yhbatch命令提交批处理脚本，批量提交作业时需将脚本复制到目标文件夹后提交，还提到了提交脚本时的环境变量设置、模块加载以及临时脚本生成等相关内容。具体提交步骤如下：    1. 进入目标路径：使用cd命令进入脚本所在目录，即cd /fs2/home/wangrong/software/ABCluster/testfiles/isomer。    2. 确认脚本存在：通过ls命令查看目录下是否存在sub.sh脚本，确保脚本已正确放置在该路径下。    3. 提交作业：使用yhbatch命令提交脚本，命令为yhbatch sub.sh。提交后系统会返回作业ID，可通过该ID查看作业状态。    4. 查看作业状态：提交完成后，使用yhq命令查看作业是否正常进入队列，确认作业ID及状态。在提交过程中，若脚本需要特定环境变量或模块支持，需在sub.sh脚本中添加相应的环境配置，如加载所需模块、设置环境变量等，以确保脚本在计算节点上正常运行。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because the answer provided a general method to check system logs but did not specifically address how to query V100 GPU status in real-time or current state on HPC4, and it mentioned using nvidia-smi which might be relevant if available but didn't confirm its availability or provide specific steps for that hardware., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.60 because there are two main contradictions: first, the command name mismatch between 'getgpulog' and 'getgpulog', which indicates a potential error in understanding or transcription; second, the claim that getgpufile provides detailed logs specifically for GPU usage may be overstated as it allows viewing all log entries without specifying exclusivity to GPU-related ones., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.7095238095238094, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.71 because there are three relevant nodes (nodes ranked 2,4 and 6) that provide information about commands related to GPUs but not specifically V100 or HPC4 context, while two irrelevant nodes (ranked 3 and 5) mention unrelated topics like A100 GPUs and account registration. The score is lower due to the lack of direct relevance for some relevant nodes., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.3409090909090909, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the input because it primarily describes how to check GPU usage on HPC4 but does not specifically address querying V100 GPUs.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8333333333333334, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not directly relevant to the user's query. It does not address how to cancel a TH-eX reservation queue for CESM in the CP6 partition., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.67 indicates that there are some inconsistencies or deviations between the retrieval context and the actual output, though not severe enough to be a major issue., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Precision (score: 0.2, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is low because most of the retrieval contexts (nodes) have a 'no' verdict except one node which has a 'yes' verdict. The first three nodes are irrelevant as they don't address the specific task of cancelling a reservation queue named 'cesm' and releasing nodes to cp6 partition, while the fifth node mentions yhcancel for canceling tasks but doesn't specify the steps or confirm that it releases nodes to cp6., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.59375, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query because it focuses on job submission and resource management in TH-eX system, but does not provide specific instructions for canceling a reservation queue or releasing nodes to cp6 partition. The closest statement mentions using yhcancel command which might be related but doesn't address the specifics of the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because the expected output mentions using yhcancel to cancel jobs and yhq to get job IDs, but it does not explicitly state that these commands are part of a specific system or provide context about how they work within SLURM-like environments., error: None)

  - input: 如何取消 TH-eX 预约队列 cesm 并释放节点到 cp6 分区中？给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，取消 TH-eX 预约队列 cesm 并释放节点到 cp6 分区中的具体步骤如下：1. 使用 yhcancel 命令取消作业，需要知道作业的 jobid，可以通过 yhq 命令查看当前运行的作业列表，找到需要取消的 cesm 作业对应的 jobid，然后执行 yhcancel jobid 命令来取消该作业。2. 取消作业后，系统会自动释放被占用的节点资源，这些节点将返回到相应的分区中，例如 cp6 分区。3. 如果需要确保节点被正确释放到 cp6 分区，可以检查分区的资源状态，确认节点是否已回到 cp6 分区的可用资源池中。需要注意的是，在取消作业时，应确保不会影响其他正在运行的任务，并且在操作前最好确认作业的状态和影响范围。

  - expected output: 取消TH-eX预约队列可使用yhcancel jobid命令，其中jobid通过yhq获取，且提交作业时可通过#SBATCH -p cp6指定分区，这些为取消预约队列并释放节点到cp6分区提供了操作基础。根据经验，具体操作步骤如下：    1. 查询cesm预约队列的作业ID：使用yhq命令查看当前所有作业，找到属于cesm预约队列的作业ID。    2. 取消cesm预约队列作业：通过yhcancel 作业ID命令取消该作业，释放其占用的节点资源。    3. 确认节点释放状态：执行yhi -l命令，查看节点详细信息，确认原cesm队列占用的节点已变为可用状态。    4. 将节点分配至cp6分区：联系系统管理员，通过管理工具将释放的节点分配到cp6分区；或编写提交脚本，在脚本中使用#SBATCH -p cp6指定分区，然后通过yhbatch 脚本名提交作业，使节点调度到cp6分区。    5. 验证节点分配结果：使用yhi -p cp6命令，查看cp6分区的节点列表，确认释放的节点已成功分配到该分区。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.8 because there might be a misunderstanding or lack of explicit reference to the specific basis (contract scale) for user permissions in the actual output, while the retrieval context only mentions general management through the yhcontrol command., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score of 1.0 indicates that all retrieved nodes are relevant, as evidenced by the first node having a positive verdict and no negative ones in this case., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4166666666666667, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide specific commands to adjust reserved resources, and while there are mentions of Einstein, they are incorrect or misleading (e.g., 'Einstein won the Nobel Prize' which is historically inaccurate as Albert Einstein did not win for physics in 1905 but later his work influenced quantum theory including the photoelectric effect). The context also does not mention adjusting resources for a specific user named chenx. Therefore, the score should be low., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output mentions adjusting node count for a reservation and creating new reservations, but does not explicitly reference any specific nodes in the retrieval context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 将TH-eX chenx 账号预约的保留资源调整为 200 个节点，给出具体命令。
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，调整TH-eX chenx账号预约的保留资源为200个节点的具体命令需要结合yhcontrol命令的使用方法和相关参数。以下是具体步骤和命令：  1. 使用yhcontrol命令更新预约的节点数量：需要使用update子命令，并指定Reservation名称和新的节点数量。例如，如果当前预约名称为chenx_reservation，则命令为yhcontrol update Reservation=chenx_reservation NodeCnt=200。  2. 确保在更新预约时指定了正确的账户和用户信息：创建预约时必须指定Users和/或Accounts，因此在更新时也需要确保这些参数正确。例如，可以添加Accounts=chenx来指定账户。  3. 调整资源可能需要联系管理员：根据文档中的信息，资源调整通常需要联系管理员进行操作，因此在执行命令前应确认是否需要管理员协助。


  - expected output: 可通过yhcontrol命令管理预约资源，例如创建预约时指定节点数、更新已有预约的节点数量等，且用户资源调整需符合系统配额限制，超出合同范围需申请修改。根据经验，将TH-eX chenx账号预约的保留资源调整为200个节点，具体步骤如下：    1. 查询当前预约信息：使用yhcontrol show reservation命令查看chenx账号现有的预约名称及节点数，找到对应的预约名称。    2. 更新预约节点数：假设预约名称为“chenxres”，执行yhcontrol update Reservation=chenxres NodeCnt=200命令，将节点数调整为200。    3. 验证调整结果：再次执行yhcontrol show reservation=chenx_res命令，确认节点数已更新为200，确保调整成功。若需新建预约，可直接执行yhcontrol create res StartTime=具体时间 Duration=持续时长 Users=chenx NodeCnt=200命令，创建包含200个节点的预约资源。操作时需注意用户权限是否符合系统配额限制，若提示权限不足，需联系管理员进行账号资源上限调整。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer is not relevant to the question because it does not address how to install FIPS software on an eX cluster with root permissions., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score is low because there are no clear contradictions provided to indicate specific discrepancies between the retrieval context and the actual output., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.5333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.53 because there are two 'yes' nodes (nodes ranked 2 and 6) that partially address aspects like installation or directory access which might relate to root permissions, but they don't explicitly mention generating machine code or configuring licenses as specified in the query. There are three 'no' nodes (nodes 1, 3, and 5) that do not cover FIPS software specifically, though node 2 provides some related information about installation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.43333333333333335, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it focuses on installing specific software (Quantum ESPRESSO and FLEXPART) on an eX cluster, which does not relate to the input question about Einstein's achievements or FIPS software., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the expected output provides a detailed step-by-step guide for installing FIPS software on an eX cluster with root privileges, including preparing the environment, configuring compilation parameters, and verifying installation and license configuration. However, the retrieval context does not contain any information about this specific process or related steps, so there is no direct support from the provided context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何在eX集群安装FIPS软件，用root权限生成机器码来配置license？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，关于在eX集群安装FIPS软件并使用root权限生成机器码来配置license的信息并未直接提及，但可以基于类似软件的安装流程进行推测。1. 安装FIPS软件通常需要通过源码编译或使用预编译的安装包，例如通过git克隆代码或从共享目录获取安装包，但具体到FIPS的安装步骤未在提供的资料中说明。2. 在类似软件如FLEXPART和Quantum ESPRESSO的安装过程中，需要加载必要的模块如MPI、grib_api、pnetcdf等，并设置环境变量，这可能也适用于FIPS软件的安装。3. 生成机器码通常涉及使用特定工具或命令行程序，可能需要以root权限运行相关脚本或命令，但具体的生成机器码的方法和命令未在提供的资料中给出。因此，建议查阅FIPS软件的官方文档或联系集群管理员获取详细的安装和配置指导。

  - expected output: 根据经验，在eX集群安装FIPS软件并使用root权限生成机器码配置license，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 准备安装环境：使用root账号登录eX集群，确保系统具备编译所需的依赖，如GCC、CMake、make等工具，安装命令如yum install gcc cmake make（适用于CentOS/RHEL系统）。    2. 获取FIPS软件安装包：将FIPS软件安装包上传至集群，例如放置在/opt目录下，使用tar -xzf fips-xxx.tar.gz解压。    3. 配置编译参数：进入解压后的源码目录，修改编译配置文件（如Makefile或CMakeLists.txt），指定安装路径和依赖库路径。若需使用MPI编译，加载相应模块：module load MPI/mpich/xxx。    4. 编译并安装软件：执行编译命令，如make && make install，安装完成后确认可执行文件路径（如/usr/local/fips/bin）。    5. 生成机器码：运行FIPS软件的机器码生成工具，通常命令为fips_gen_machine_code，生成的机器码文件（如machine_code.txt）会包含硬件信息。    6. 配置license文件：将生成的机器码发送至license供应商，获取license文件后，放置在指定目录（如/usr/local/fips/license），并修改环境变量指向该文件：export FIPS_LICENSE=/usr/local/fips/license/license.dat。    7. 验证安装与license配置：运行FIPS软件测试案例，检查是否成功加载license，例如执行fips_test -v，查看输出中是否显示license有效信息。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score is low due to several contradictions: first, the retrieval context does not mention any CUDA library damage or path conflicts errors, while the actual output claims these issues exist; second, it specifies PyTorch 1.10 with CUDA Toolkit 11.4 but the context recommends using PyTorch 1.12 and CUDA 11.6 for NVIDIA A100 GPUs., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.9028571428571428, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The contextual precision score is 0.90 because there are two nodes (node rank 4 and node rank 6) that have a 'no' verdict but should be ranked higher than some irrelevant ones., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.22580645161290322, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it focuses on Conda verification errors and package corruption issues, while the user's query specifically asks about PyTorch version mismatch with CUDA causing CUDA unavailable error., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Recall (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because there are some matching points between the expected output and the retrieval context but they don't cover all aspects comprehensively., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 遇到PyTorch版本不匹配导致CUDA不可用的问题，请给出解决方案。
  - actual output: 遇到PyTorch版本不匹配导致CUDA不可用的问题，可以通过以下方法解决：1. 创建新的conda环境并安装指定版本的PyTorch及相关库，例如安装PyTorch 1.12.1、torchvision 0.13.1和torchaudio 0.12.1，并配合CUDA Toolkit 11.6，确保版本兼容性。2. 如果出现CondaVerificationError或ClobberError错误，可能是由于CUDA库损坏或路径冲突，可以尝试清理缓存、重新下载包或调整环境配置。3. 若系统CUDA版本与PyTorch不兼容，应选择与系统CUDA版本匹配的PyTorch版本，例如在CUDA 11.4环境下安装PyTorch 1.10.1，并通过conda安装命令完成安装。


  - expected output: 云主机中，通过创建新的conda环境，安装PyTorch 1.12.1、torchvision 0.13.1、torchaudio 0.12.1，并搭配CUDA Toolkit 11.6，解决了PyTorch版本不匹配导致的CUDA不可用问题，安装后测试成功，CUDA可用。TIB - GPU系统安装PyTorch包时出现CondaVerificationError和ClobberError错误，前者是多个CUDA库（如libcusolver、libnpp）的包损坏，表现为文件路径缺失或文件大小不匹配；后者是不同包共享相同路径（如bin/cjpeg、bin/djpeg）所致。系统中NVIDIA A100 GPU的CUDA版本为11.4，使用CUDA 10.2的PyTorch时出现不兼容警告，建议安装与CUDA 11.3兼容的PyTorch 1.10.1版本，并通过conda命令完成安装。问题原因分析：    1. PyTorch与CUDA版本不匹配：PyTorch对CUDA版本有严格要求，若安装的PyTorch版本对应的CUDA版本与系统实际CUDA版本不一致，会导致CUDA不可用。例如，系统CUDA为11.4，而使用CUDA 10.2的PyTorch就会出现不兼容警告。    2. 安装包损坏或冲突：安装过程中包损坏（如libcusolver、libnpp等CUDA库文件缺失或大小错误），或不同包共享相同路径（如jpeg相关包的bin/cjpeg、bin/djpeg路径冲突），会引发安装错误，进而导致CUDA不可用。    3. 环境配置问题：已存在的conda环境可能存在配置冲突，影响PyTorch与CUDA的正常关联。解决方案：    1. 创建新conda环境并安装匹配版本：        a. 创建新环境：conda create -n torch_env python=3.8        b 激活环境：conda activate torch_env。        c. 安装匹配的PyTorch及相关包，根据系统CUDA版本选择：            若系统CUDA为11.6，安装：conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge。            若系统CUDA为11.3，安装：conda install pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch。    2. 解决安装包问题：        a. 清理conda缓存：conda clean -i（清理索引缓存）、conda clean -p（清理未使用的包）、conda clean -t（清理临时文件）。        b. 重新下载安装包：删除损坏的包后重新安装，如conda remove libcusolver libnpp，再重新执行安装命令。        c. 处理包冲突：若出现ClobberError，可尝试指定具体包版本或使用--force-reinstall强制重装，如conda install jpeg=9d -f。    3. 验证CUDA可用性：安装完成后，进入Python环境，输入import torch，print(torch.cuda.is_available())，若输出True，则CUDA可用；同时可查看支持的CUDA设备：print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))。
