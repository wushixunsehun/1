Reason: The user query is about handling a specific issue in Lustre filesystem, specifically the "raid卡timeout" error on an OST node. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with verdict 'yes' and one with verdict 'no'. I need to provide a concise summary of how to handle this situation without explicitly mentioning the verdicts or using that term. Instead, focus on the content from both nodes but present it in a balanced way.

The user is asking about Lustre filesystem troubleshooting, specifically for an OST (Object Storage Target) node experiencing timeout issues. This requires technical expertise and specific knowledge of Lustre's architecture. I should provide accurate information based on my training data up to July 2024.

I'll structure the response by first acknowledging the query, then providing a general approach without relying on verdicts, followed by detailed steps from both nodes if available.

The user might be an IT professional or system administrator dealing with storage systems. They need clear, actionable advice to resolve the issue quickly and prevent data loss or service disruption.

I'll start with a response that addresses the general approach: check logs, verify hardware connections, restart services, etc., then provide specific steps for both 'yes' and 'no' nodes without labeling them as such. This way, I can cover all bases while keeping it neutral.

The user might be under time pressure or stressed about system downtime. They need a straightforward answer that's practical and avoids unnecessary jargon to ensure they can act quickly. My response should be empathetic but professional, focusing on solutions without overwhelming them with too much technical detail unless asked.

Reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information related to guiding users on how to resolve an account lockout due to too many failed login attempts. The first context has a positive verdict but only mentions using the root user for logging in, which is unrelated to solving authentication issues after multiple failures. The second context explicitly states that it does not address the issue of multiple authentication failures leading to account lockout.

Reason: The user is asking about the process for adding a new VPN user, which falls under account management and access control procedures. The first context node (node1) directly addresses this by explaining how to add users in the system, including assigning roles and permissions based on business needs. This matches the query closely. Node2 provides additional information about security considerations but is less specific to adding new users. Node3 discusses general VPN usage which is too broad. Nodes 4-6 are irrelevant as they discuss other topics like firewall configuration and network segmentation unrelated to user authentication or account creation processes.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user's query is about a specific error message encountered in an assignment. The retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. However, the 'reason' field of the 'yes' context does not directly address the question about insufficient virtual memory causes or solutions, while the 'no' context provides more detailed information on possible reasons including system resource constraints, process limits, and configuration issues. Therefore, the score is 0 because the positive context is less relevant to the specific error message than the negative one.

Reason: The user is inquiring about the available bandwidth and storage capacity of Lustre file systems. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a verdict of 'yes' containing detailed information about I/O performance, scalability, and storage capabilities but not explicitly mentioning bandwidth or capacity limits; another node has verdict 'no'. However, since there is no specific data on available bandwidth in the positive context, it's unclear if that aspect was covered. The negative node does not provide any relevant information regarding these specifications either. Therefore, I cannot definitively confirm the exact figures for Lustre file system availability or capacity without more specific details from the user.

Reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not include any content related to the user's query about "Lustre file system". The first context has a verdict of 'yes' but it is actually discussing the fault tolerance mechanisms in general, not specifically for LustreFS or its specific features like fault detection and recovery procedures which are implied by the term 故障切换 (fault switching). There might be confusion between general fault tolerance concepts and the specific feature of Lustre. The second context does not address the query at all.

Score: 0.8333333333333333
Reason: The retrieval result has high precision because it includes contexts that are highly relevant to controlling job partitions and system configurations related to job scheduling. The first context is about yhcontrol parameters for job control, the second one mentions updating job specifications with a parameter similar to account management (Account=accountname), and the third discusses node configuration in HPC environments which can be linked to job scheduling systems like Slurm where nodes are managed. However, there might be some tangential relevance as all three contexts touch upon system administration aspects but not directly on Nobel Prizes or winning them.

Reason: The user is asking about the output of a command, and the retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' which directly addresses the question. The other context has verdict 'no'. However, the score is 1.0, indicating that all retrieved nodes are relevant or not? Wait, no: the score is calculated as (number of yes - number of no) / total, so if there's one yes and one no, then it would be (1-0)/2 = 0.5, but wait let me check the example again.

Without explicit details on the report types or their corresponding options, I cannot confirm which ones are available.

Reason: The user's question is about testing network connectivity between multiple nodes, which requires a multi-step approach. First, you need to identify the specific protocol or service running on top of ICMP (ping) and TCP/IP stack like DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP etc., because ping uses ICMP and doesn't test application-layer protocols.

Reason: The user's question is about how to use a command related to triggers, but it seems there might be a typo or incomplete context. The term 'yhtrigger' appears to be misspelled; the correct term should likely be 'Yunhai trigger', which refers to a specific feature in Huawei devices for triggering YOLO models with an API call. However, the user's question is not clear about what exactly they are asking - whether it's about setting up triggers or creating a trigger condition. The answer provided does not address this ambiguity and instead focuses on general information about 'yhtrigger' which doesn't exist in standard contexts, leading to irrelevance.

Reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about Lustre file system configuration or management, as it focuses on general concepts and historical facts unrelated to specific Lustre configuration details.

Reason: The user's query is about how to use the `changelog_mask` feature in Lustre file systems for fine-grained control over changelog logging. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict ('yes') and another with a negative verdict ('no'). However, the 'reasons' field in both nodes contains placeholder text or incomplete information (e.g., '...'), which limits the ability to assess their relevance fully. Since there is no specific content from retrieval contexts provided for the 'no' node, it's unclear what exactly constitutes an irrelevant context here. The user seems to be asking about a technical configuration aspect of Lustre filesystems, specifically regarding changelog management and its impact on performance or functionality in high-performance computing environments. This requires detailed information not available in the given retrieval contexts.

Reason: The user is asking about understanding and application of the "dom_stripesize" parameter, specifically in relation to enabling Data-on MDT feature. The retrieval contexts provided include information on stripe configuration for performance optimization, which directly addresses storage system configurations related to data striping. However, there are no direct mentions of the term "Data-on MDT", suggesting a possible mismatch or lack of specific context about that feature. Also, one context is missing key details like how it affects performance or its role in Data-on MDT.

Reason: The user's query is about optimizing small file access performance in Lustre filesystem for HPC environments. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: the first node has verdict 'yes' and discusses how to optimize I/O operations by adjusting stripe parameters, while the second node with verdict 'no' suggests using a different approach. Both are relevant but not directly addressing the specific issue of small file access in Lustre.

Reason: The user is asking about configuring the scheduling policy for Lustre OST (Object Storage Target) services in Lustre file system to optimize performance. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict and one with negative. However, the question specifically asks about 'OST service' which refers to Object Storage Targets in the context of CephFS or distributed storage systems. In the first node (node 1), it discusses configuring NRS parameters for general Lustre configuration but does not mention OST services explicitly. The second node (node 2) directly addresses the scheduling policy and its impact on performance, which is relevant to the user's query about optimizing read/write operations in distributed storage systems like CephFS. Therefore, I will rank node 1 as less relevant because it doesn't specifically address OST service configuration for Lustre, while node 2 provides more direct information on tuning parameters including scheduling policies.

Reason: The user's query is about optimizing Lustre file system performance by configuring readahead parameters. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a detailed explanation of the `lctl setparam` command for adjusting preadv parameters, and another that explains how to use `pNFS` features for large reads. Both are relevant because they address specific tuning techniques for Lustre's read-ahead behavior in high-performance storage systems.

The negative node is more specific about the parameters mentioned by the user (lockd, dlm, ganesha). Since the user's query specifically asks for memory usage control via two particular parameters, and both nodes are somewhat relevant but not directly answering with detailed guidance or confirmation on how to set these exact parameters, they do not sufficiently address the core of the question about limiting client-side memory consumption. The answer should be no.'

Reason: The user is asking about configuring thread counts for MDT services in Lustre filesystem to optimize metadata processing performance. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict and one with negative. However, the positive node (node1) provides detailed information on how to adjust mdt threads by modifying configuration files or using commands like 'modprobe' and 'modifying kernel parameters'. It covers both minimum and maximum thread counts, which aligns well with the user's query about adjusting min/max values for MDT services. The negative node (node2) discusses general performance tuning but does not specifically address Lustre MDT threads configuration or provide actionable steps related to that topic. Therefore, the positive node is more relevant and directly addresses the question while the negative one is too generic.

Reason: The user is asking about configuring adaptive timeout parameters in Lustre filesystem for latency-sensitive scenarios. The retrieval contexts provided include one with a verdict of 'yes' and several with 'no'. However, the positive context node does not directly address the specific configuration steps or best practices for adjusting these parameters. It only mentions that timeouts are configurable but doesn't specify how to set adaptive_timeout_min/max appropriately for network conditions. Negative nodes mention unrelated topics like system restarts, hardware issues, and general troubleshooting which don't align with the query's focus on client-side tuning. The user likely expects a direct answer about configuration steps or parameters' effects.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not contain any information about Lustre file system parameters or network configurations, and instead focuses on unrelated topics like Albert Einstein's biography.

Reason: The user's query is about configuring TBF (Token Bucket Filter) parameters in Lustre filesystem to limit the rate of RPC requests from a specific client. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: node1 and node2. Node1 provides detailed information on how to set up TBF for limiting request rates, including setting limits per second and burst capacity. It explains that adjusting these parameters can help control traffic effectively. Node2 discusses the impact of high-rate I/O operations on system performance but does not provide specific configuration details or mention TBF/TBF directly. Therefore, node1 is more relevant to the query than node2.

Score: 0.5
Reason: The score is 0.5 because there are some contradictions in the claim and the retrieved context.

First contradiction: The claim states that 'OST' refers to a system responsible for metadata management, but the retrieval context does not mention any role of OST in metadata handling; it only mentions that files are stored on OSTs (Outlook Offline Storage Files) which is a different function. Second contradiction: The claim says 'OST manages file data', while the retrieved text states that data is read from OST by MFT, so there might be an ambiguity or lack of clarity regarding who actually handles the management.

Reason: The user query is about adjusting I/O statistics collection settings for a specific tool called 'Jobstats'. However, the assistant's response does not address how to adjust these settings or provide any relevant information on Jobstats. Instead, it provides general advice about checking system logs and contacting support, which may be helpful but doesn't directly answer the question.

Reason: The user's question is about optimizing Lustre file system performance for frequent read/write operations on small files in a high-performance computing cluster environment. The assistant provided detailed technical advice including configuration adjustments, hardware recommendations, and specific tuning parameters. However, the response did not address the core issue of identifying which Lustre mechanisms to use specifically for improving I/O performance for small file access. Instead, it focused on general storage optimization strategies without differentiating between large files or small files. The user's question was clear about 'small files', but the advice given does't directly tackle that specific scenario.

Reason: The user's query is about the Lustre file system and its use of reserved space parameters. The response correctly mentions that Lustre uses Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for storage management, but does not explicitly mention LSoM or how it manages reserved space differently from traditional filesystems. However, the key point in the contradiction is that the user mentioned 'LSoM' while the correct term should be 'Logical Volumes'. The response did not address this discrepancy and instead provided information about LVM (Logical Volume Manager) which is a different concept altogether. This might confuse users looking for specific Lustre configuration details on reserved space management, as they may think that Lustre uses LVM or LVM tools for storage management when it actually has its own system called 'Lustre Logical Volumes' or similar concepts but not exactly the same as LVM (Logical Volume Manager). The response should have clarified this point to avoid confusion and provide accurate information about Lustre's reserved space mechanism.

Score: 0.5
Reason: The answer does not address the specific configuration details for configuring TBF (Token Bucket Filter) on Lustre filesystem using parameters like ost_lsm_tbf_rule_add or similar commands. It only describes general concepts of token bucket filters and their purpose, but doesn't provide any technical steps or examples relevant to Lustre.

Reason: The actual output does not contradict the retrieval context; however, there is a discrepancy between the year mentioned (1968 vs 1921). The retrieval context states that Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and was awarded the prize during the announcement of relativity. However, the actual output says he won it in 1968 which is incorrect.

Reason: The user's query is about how to mount a Lustre file system with labels and specify the failover mode. The retrieval contexts provided include information on using `--label` or `-L` options for label-based mounting, but do not explicitly mention the 'failover' aspect in the context of specifying the failover mode. However, they are related as both involve labeling filesystems. One context mentions that labels can be used to identify specific file systems and mount them accordingly, which is relevant because it involves using labels (or tags) for identification and mounting based on those labels. The other contexts mention general information about Lustre, but do not directly address the failover mode parameter. Therefore, the retrieved nodes are somewhat related but lack direct confirmation of the 'failover.mode' parameter.

Reason: The user's query is about configuring multi-path routing in Lustre filesystem to balance load across multiple network interfaces, particularly InfiniBand. The retrieval contexts provided include information on using lnetdump and monitoring tools for debugging, but do not address the specific configuration steps or parameters like ip2nets mentioned by the user. While relevant, they are too generic and lack detailed instructions on how to configure multi-track networks with IP addresses and subnet masks as per 'ip2nets'. The answer should focus more on diagnostic commands rather than actual configuration methods for load balancing.

Score: 0.8333333333333333
Reason: The score of 0.83 indicates that retrieval contexts have a moderate level of relevance to the query. The highest-ranked node has a 'yes' verdict with strong alignment on attaching and getting I/O data, but there is no explicit mention of real-time monitoring or specific filters in the top nodes.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information related to Prometheus data types, specifically gauge metrics. The first context has a verdict of 'yes' but does not mention Prometheus at all, making it irrelevant. The second context is the only one that mentions Prometheus in relation to radiation and plasma physics, which is unrelated to programming or data types.

Reason: The user is inquiring about the functions of two specific tools or systems: yhacctmgr and yhcontrol. The retrieval contexts provided include a node on how to use YHWT (which includes yhcms) for managing accounts, but does not mention yhacctmgr or yhcontrol specifically. However, it mentions that users can manage multiple accounts with the same email by using different subdomains in the account management section. This is somewhat related as both tools are part of a system for user management and authentication, but they don't directly address the specific functions of yhacctmgr and yhcontrol. The node about YH-801 (yhcms) does not mention these terms at all. The other nodes might be irrelevant or unrelated to the query.'

Reason: The user is asking about the difference between two parameters, max_dirty_mb_per_osc and max_dirty_mb_per_client. These are both related to memory management in Linux systems, specifically virtual memory statistics. The first parameter controls the maximum number of dirty pages per page cgroup for a specific control group (cgroup) while the second one is not valid or recognized as such.

Reason: The user's query is about adjusting configuration parameters to address performance issues related to frequent lock contention in the Lustre file system. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a verdict of 'yes' and another with 'no'. However, I notice that the 'reasons' field for both nodes seems incomplete or improperly formatted as per the example JSON structure. Typically, such fields would contain detailed explanations justifying their respective verdicts. Since the actual content is not provided in these contexts, it's impossible to determine which node should be considered relevant based on standard evaluation criteria.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user is inquiring about the difference between two parameters, `ostf_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`, which appear to be typos or variations of a common term. The original query mentions `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` but then uses `ost_tbf` and `mdt_tbf`. I suspect the user meant `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank` respectively, as these are likely typos or autocorrect errors in the input. However, to proceed with answering, I'll assume they mean `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`. The user is asking about two parameters that seem related but have different acronyms: one starting with 'ost' and the other with 'mdt'. These are likely typos or autocorrect errors. Since I don't have specific context, I'll provide a general explanation based on common patterns in programming contexts.

In software development, especially in frameworks like React, `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` might refer to something related to state management or routing (if 'ost' is meant to be 'other'). Similarly, `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank` could relate to data handling or another component. But without specific context, it's hard to determine the exact meaning.

The user likely wants a comparison between these two parameters in terms of their function and usage. I'll provide a general explanation based on common naming conventions:

- `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` (assuming corrected) might be related to handling state or object-related changes, while `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank` could relate to data transformation or business logic.

However, note that the user's query has typos. The correct terms should probably be `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`. I'll proceed with this assumption for clarity.

Reason: The user's query is about optimizing recovery efficiency in Lustre filesystem, specifically mentioning the use of imperative recovery mechanisms and adjusting the recovery window. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a verdict 'yes' that discusses the configuration steps for enabling specific features like L1 cache hit rate optimization, but does not mention imperative recovery or recovery windows; another node has verdict 'no'. Without explicit information on how to configure imperative recovery mechanisms in Lustre, I cannot provide detailed instructions. However, the user's query is about a specific technical topic that requires domain-specific knowledge and access to system logs for accurate diagnosis.

Reason: The retrieval contexts provided all contain information about tuning Lustre file system parameters related to RPC timeouts and performance optimization under high load conditions. They directly address the technical aspects of adjusting specific parameters (like max_rpcs_in_flight) to improve timeout handling in a clustered environment, which aligns with the user's query on configuring Lustre for better performance during high load.

Reason: The user's query is about Lustre file system and handling OST degradation. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a verdict of 'yes' that directly addresses the question, and one with 'no'. However, the positive verdict node does not provide any specific steps or parameters for marking OST down; it only states that the user should check logs to see if there are issues. This is insufficient because the query asks for detailed operational procedures (steps and parameters). The negative verdict nodes do not contain relevant information at all.

Reason: The answer does not directly address the question about how to mount a filesystem with labels in Linux, but instead discusses general concepts of label-based systems and file system labeling. The user asked specifically about 'labeling' files or directories for fault tolerance using Lustre's failover feature, which is related to storage systems and high availability setups.

Reason: The user's question is about using yhalloc and yhattach to apply for resources, but there are several issues with the response. First, it does not mention how to use these commands at all; instead, it focuses on general advice without addressing the specific tools mentioned in the query. Second, the answer provides generic information that doesn't align with the user's request about 'yhalloc' and 'yhattach'. Third, the answer is too vague and fails to provide any step-by-step instructions or examples for using yhalloc specifically.

The assistant's response provided detailed technical steps for configuring various parameters related to GFS (GlusterFS) and GlusterFS, which are distributed filesystems, but did not address imperative recovery at all. It also focused on general storage configuration aspects like NVRAM and network settings without addressing the specific requirement of imperative recovery or recovery window adjustment. The response is missing key information about how to enable imperative recovery in CephFS.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user's query is asking for the number of computing nodes currently on the system that are in a down state. The retrieval contexts provided include two entries: one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. However, the score is given as 1.00, which indicates perfect precision. This suggests that all retrieved documents or nodes are relevant to the query. But let's analyze each node separately.

The first context has a verdict of 'yes', meaning it is relevant. The second one has a verdict of 'no'. Since there are two contexts and one is relevant while the other is not, the precision score cannot be 1.0 unless both are considered equally relevant or if the system considers only the top-k retrieved nodes for calculation.

The user query is about counting down nodes, but the retrieval context does not provide any numerical value or specific information to answer that question directly. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding in the scoring criteria. The score of 1.0 implies all retrieved contexts are relevant, but based on content analysis, neither context provides a direct count or status update about how many nodes are down.

The first node (ranked higher) has verdict 'yes' and likely contains information that is positive for the query, while the second node has verdict 'no'. However, without specific details in either, it's hard to determine if they are both relevant. But since one of them is irrelevant, even if ranked above, precision cannot be 100% unless only one context was retrieved and it was deemed relevant.

The user might expect a direct answer like 'There are currently X nodes down' or something similar, but the retrieval contexts don't provide that information. The score should reflect how well the system is able to retrieve relevant documents given the query. Here, even though both contexts mention some aspect related to node status (e.g., one says yes and the other no), they do not directly answer the specific count or state of down nodes.

Therefore, I think there might be an error in the scoring or interpretation. The score is 1.0 only if all retrieved contexts are relevant, but here we have at least one irrelevant context (the 'no' verdict node). However, perhaps the system considers that both contexts are still somewhat related to the query? Or maybe the retrieval system returned two nodes and both were considered relevant for some reason.

But based on strict relevance, if there is a retrieved node with verdict 'no', then precision cannot be 1.0 unless all retrieved nodes are relevant. The score of 1.0 might indicate that the top-k contexts (if k=2) are all relevant, but in this case, one is irrelevant.

The user's query is about system status and node states, so both verdicts could be considered as related to the same topic. However, precision specifically measures how many of the retrieved items are relevant. With two nodes retrieved, one yes and one no, the precision for k=2 would not be 100% unless all retrieved contexts are relevant.

In conclusion, I think there is a mistake in the score assignment or retrieval process because an irrelevant node was included.

Reason: The user's query is asking for the number of OSDs (Object Storage Devices) in a Lustre file system, which directly relates to how many OSTs are used. The retrieval contexts provided include one context with verdict 'yes' and reasons about the relationship between OSDs and OSTs being similar, but not identical, and another context with verdict 'no' that states they are different roles. However, since the user is asking for a specific number or configuration detail, neither response provides a direct answer to the question. The 'yes' node does not give a numerical value, only an analogy comparison, while the 'no' node directly answers but incorrectly identifies them as distinct entities. Neither context fully addresses the query's request for a specific count or confirmation of OSDs being OSTs.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not contain any information about Einstein or relativity, despite some statements mentioning Einstein and Einstein which are likely typos of "Einstein". The context fails to address the user's query regarding CPU usage statistics.

Reason: The user's query is asking for the current network speed of a specific cluster (3F Cluster). The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information about the current network speed or performance metrics. There might be some confusion with the term "Contextual Precision Score" which seems to refer to an evaluation metric, but in this case, it's unclear what exactly is being referred to as there are no specific details given for a 3F cluster. The user may have misspelled 'score' or meant something else by 'Contextual Precision Score'. Without explicit data on the network speed of the 3F cluster from the retrieval contexts, I cannot provide an accurate answer.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user is inquiring about the lowest network delay among nodes, and the retrieval contexts provided include two types: one with verdict 'yes' indicating a node that might be relevant to low latency or high performance (node1), and another with verdict 'no' which does not directly address the query. However, the 'yes' context provides specific information about node characteristics related to network performance, while the 'no' contexts are either irrelevant or less directly related.

The answer provided does not address the running time or duration of the process but instead explains how to check system processes and resource usage using commands like `ps` and `top`. This response is off-topic as it doesn't provide any information about the actual running time of the specified PID.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The first node has a verdict of 'yes' and it directly addresses the query by mentioning "failed test cases" which is part of the user's request, while the second node with verdict 'no' does not contain any relevant information about failed tests. Therefore, the retrieval system prioritized the most relevant document correctly.

Reason: The retrieval result has a high contextual precision score of 1.0, indicating that all retrieved nodes are relevant to the user's query. The first node provides direct advice on resolving task interruption issues by checking job submission methods and environment variables, which directly addresses the problem described in the query about 'task running interrupted'. However, the second node has a verdict of 'no' because it does not relate to the issue at all; it discusses unrelated topics like Nobel Prizes and Albert Einstein. The user's query is about task interruption during execution, so nodes that do not address this specific technical problem are irrelevant.

Reason: The user's query is asking for the cause of a specific error in computational chemistry simulations. The retrieval contexts provided are relevant as they address similar technical problems: one discusses NaN (Not a Number) errors due to coordinate issues or parameter errors, and another mentions normalizing data to handle large values. However, the first context does not directly mention GROMACS but refers to GROMACS which is likely a typo for GROMACS, and it provides advice on potential energy calculations in molecular dynamics simulations. The second context talks about normalization of data when dealing with very large numbers, which can prevent numerical instability that might lead to NaNs. Both contexts are relevant as they deal with computational simulation errors related to numerical issues or configuration problems.

Reason: The user's query is asking for the reason behind a specific account not logging in. The retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. However, without knowing what NCHUZL refers to or any additional context about this particular issue, it's impossible to determine if there was an error message or cause related to that specific account.

Reason: The user's query is about troubleshooting a specific error when using the `yp_run` command with an account named 'hpc2019' on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one positive and one negative. The positive node mentions that yhrun is part of PBS Professional software used in HPC environments, specifically for job scheduling and execution management. It also states that the error 'communication connection failure' typically occurs due to network issues or configuration problems between the scheduler host and compute nodes. This aligns with the user's issue about communication failures during job submission on a cluster system.

The negative node does not provide any specific information related to the query, so it is less relevant for troubleshooting this particular error message.

Therefore, the retrieval contexts are ranked by relevance: first the positive node (rank 1) and then the negative one (rank 2). The score of 1.0 indicates that the most relevant context is the positive one, which directly addresses the issue in a way that matches the user's problem.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user's query is about analyzing a specific error related to running multiple MPI jobs in parallel, which requires domain-specific knowledge. The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information about this issue or similar ones. Therefore, the retrieved nodes are irrelevant and should be excluded from consideration for scoring.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user is inquiring about the causes and solutions for errors encountered when using a system called EX系统用户作业报. The retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' which directly addresses the query, but also includes irrelevant nodes that do not relate to the specific error mentioned by the user. However, there are two other nodes: node 1 has verdict 'no', and node 2 has verdict 'yes'. But note that the score is given as 1.00 for contextual precision, which indicates a high level of relevance. The user's query seems to be about troubleshooting an error in EX system user job reporting or something similar. The retrieval contexts are not provided here, so I cannot analyze them directly.

Reason: The user is inquiring about checking the status of HPC4 nodes, specifically asking how to check node 33. The retrieval contexts provided include one with a verdict 'yes' and several with 'no'. However, the positive context (verdict: yes) does not provide any information on how to check HPC nodes or specific instructions for node 33. It only states that there is no known issue but doesn't offer actionable steps. The negative contexts are more helpful as they explain various methods and tools for checking system status including monitoring, logs, and configuration files. They also mention specific commands like 'systemctl' and provide detailed examples of how to check node status in a cluster environment.

Reason: The user's query is about analyzing the reasons for a specific error in a HPC cluster environment, and the assistant provided an answer that does not address this issue at all. It starts by stating 'I am sorry but I cannot provide any information regarding gambling' which seems to be a safety filter response, then shifts to discussing general aspects of high-performance computing without addressing the user's specific problem about PMIx errors or collective operations in MPI (Message Passing Interface) applications.

Reason: The user's question is about troubleshooting a specific error message related to an 'EX system' and the term 'user operation'. The assistant provided a detailed explanation of what EX systems are, their components, and general advice on checking connections. However, it did not address the specific error code or provide any steps to resolve the issue. While some technical details about network cables were mentioned, they are too vague and do not directly relate to 'EX system user operation'.

Reason: The user's question is about checking system memory usage during runtime, which falls under system monitoring and resource management tasks. The assistant provided an incorrect answer by suggesting the 'free -m' command without providing context or explanation for its use in this scenario. Additionally, the answer could be improved by mentioning other relevant commands like 'free', 'top', 'htop', etc., but it is not necessary as the user only asked about checking memory usage.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user is asking about how to disable a specific feature on the TH-eX platform. The first context node (node1) directly addresses turning off VNC services, which matches the query closely. Node2 and beyond are irrelevant as they discuss unrelated topics like system architecture or general instructions without addressing the specific service control instruction.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Einstein's nationality or birthplace, and the user query specifically asks for information on how to add -reservation=x11 permissions.

Reason: The user's query is about granting permissions or access to a specific account (liuyuansh) on a system, which falls under the category of security and authorization. The provided retrieval contexts do not contain any information related to Redhat systems, let alone HPC clusters with multiple nodes like TH-HPC4. There is no mention of user accounts, permissions, or node management in these contexts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer as there's insufficient context.

Reason: The retrieval contexts are ranked appropriately. The first context is about monitoring GPU usage and mentions nvidia-smimf which is a related tool but not exactly matching V100. However, it still provides relevant information on checking GPU status in HPC environments. The second context is irrelevant as it discusses performance testing unrelated to the query.'s score should be 2/3 because there are two 'yes' nodes and one 'no' node, so average score is (2*1 + 1*0)/3 = 0.67.

Reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about adding fonts or font management, and instead focuses on Einstein's personal details and scientific achievements unrelated to the topic.

Reason: The user's query is about adjusting the reserved resources for a specific account (TH-eX chenx) to 200 nodes. The retrieval contexts provided include two entries: one with verdict 'yes' and reasons mentioning resource allocation, node management, and adjustment of node counts; another with verdict 'no' but no specific reason given. However, the user's query does not specify which system or context this is for (e.g., Kubernetes, networking, etc.), so it might be ambiguous without more details.

Reason: The user is asking for a solution to a problem with PyTorch and CUDA, which falls under the category of technical troubleshooting. The previous response provided detailed steps on checking versions, updating drivers, etc., but did not address the specific issue of CUDA version mismatch or driver compatibility issues that are common causes for this error. Therefore, I think it is necessary to provide more targeted advice.

Score: 0.5
Reason: The claim contains two main contradictions with the provided retrieval context. First, it states that Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics for relativity, which is incorrect as he was awarded in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. Second, it claims Einstein was a German chef, but the context clearly indicates he was born in Germany and moved to Italy at age five due to political reasons.

Reason: The user is asking about installing FIPS software on an Exadata database machine. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict and reasons, and another with negative. However, the question specifically asks for installation instructions which are not present in either context. Neither context provides step-by-step guidance or specific commands for installation. One might expect this to be covered under system administration topics but both contexts lack detailed steps. The user's query is about a technical procedure requiring specific actions like using sudo or root access, while the retrieved nodes do not provide such instructions. Hence, neither node addresses the core need adequately.

Score: 0.5
Reason: The answer provided does not address the question about adding custom fonts, instead it discusses general font management and mentions a feature that is not available in THF (the Font Book tool). The user specifically asked for steps to add user-defined fonts on THF, but the response did't provide any such instructions. Therefore, the relevance score should be low because there is no direct answer provided.

Reason: The user's query is about writing an MPI job script for a specific system configuration. The retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' and several with 'no'. However, the positive verdict context provides detailed information on how to structure the script including node count, processes per node, and binding options which directly addresses the user's request. The negative verdicts mention unrelated topics like using Singularity containers or specific hardware configurations that are not relevant to writing a basic job submission script for an HPC system with 2 nodes and 48 cores each.

Reason: The user's query is about designing a script to monitor disk usage and send alerts, which aligns with the topic of monitoring system resources. The retrieval contexts provided include information on writing shell scripts for cron jobs (node 1), checking storage space in Linux (node 2), sending emails via command line (node 3), and using Python for automation tasks including email notifications (node 4). These are all relevant to the user's request, but they don't directly address the specific requirement of monitoring disk usage. The most direct answer is node 1 which provides a complete solution with examples in various languages including shell script, so it should be ranked highest.

Reason: The user is inquiring about the impact time and scope of TH-eX machine operation. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. However, the question specifically asks for a specific technical detail (impact duration) which might not be covered by both equally. The node with verdict 'yes' likely provides more relevant information as it aligns directly with the user's query about impact time, while the 'no' nodes may contain less direct or general information.

Reason: The user query is asking for possible causes of a specific issue on node TH-3M1 where running dsp programs caused the system to go down. The retrieval context provided includes information about Lustre file system issues, specifically resource exhaustion (ENOSPC) and synchronization problems between MDS and OSTs. These are directly relevant as they address potential causes for system instability when certain operations fail or errors occur in a distributed storage system like Lustre. Therefore, the score is 1 because the retrieved contexts are highly relevant to the user's problem.

The user's query specifically mentions "signal 9" which is a common Unix/Linux signal for segmentation fault. Contexts mention similar errors and solutions involving UCX components, so the score should remain high.

Reason: The user query asks about the differences between login nodes and compute nodes in HPC systems, specifically regarding what users can do on each. The answer provided does not address this question directly or indirectly. It describes general aspects of HPC clusters but doesn't specify operations allowed on login nodes versus compute nodes. While it mentions that login nodes are for user access and compute nodes handle computations, the key distinction in terms of user permissions is missing. Compute nodes typically require job scheduling systems like Slurm to allocate resources, so users cannot directly run jobs or use GPUs there without proper allocation; they can only do so after being granted access by a scheduler.

However, the user asked about '登录节点' (login nodes) specifically, but the response did not directly address the second part of the question regarding what users cannot do on login nodes. The answer should have explicitly mentioned that typically, you are restricted from running long-running tasks or resource-intensive operations on a login node due to its limited resources and purpose for interactive use only.

The response provided detailed instructions for running an example program with mpirun or mpiexec using 4 nodes, but did not address how to submit it as a batch job in Slurm. It also didn't mention any specific commands related to submitting jobs on HPC systems like sbatch or qsub, nor did it provide information about the number of processes per node (ppn) and interconnect configuration which are crucial for multi-node setups. The user might be using an older version of Open MPI that doesn't support the 'cpus-per-task' option, so I should have suggested checking the version and providing a fallback method if needed.

Reason: The user's query is about the storage space issue on /data/diskA, and the assistant provided a detailed explanation of how to check disk usage with df command. However, the response does not address the specific error message 'grace: 6d23h' which seems unusual or unclear in this context. The user might be referring to an error message or some other issue, but it is not mentioned in the assistant's response. Also, the advice given about checking /var/log/df and using df -h does not directly relate to the storage fullness causing system performance issues; they are more general suggestions without addressing the root cause indicated by 'grace: 6d23h'. The user might be experiencing a specific error related to this message, but it's unclear. Therefore, the response is only partially relevant and misses key points about the error itself.

Reason: The user's query is about designing a script to monitor disk usage and send alerts when it exceeds 90%. The assistant provided an answer that does not address the monitoring aspect at all. It only describes how to check free space on multiple disks, but doesn't mention any alerting mechanism or threshold condition (like exceeding 10%) which is crucial for a monitoring script. Also, the response focuses solely on command-line tools and specific commands without addressing the core requirement of sending alerts when usage exceeds 90%. The user might be looking for a more comprehensive solution that includes checking multiple directories and sending email notifications or other actions upon reaching threshold.

Reason: The user's query is about installing CMAQ v5.4 on HPC systems, which requires specific environmental configurations and modifications to the Makefile based on system architecture. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict (node1) and one with negative verdicts (nodes2-6). However, without knowing what these verdicts refer to or how they are determined, it's impossible to provide a specific reason for each node.

Score: 1.0
Reason: The user's query is about analyzing an error message related to memory issues in Gromacs software, specifically the "not enough memory" error. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with verdict 'yes' and reasons mentioning common causes like input file errors or insufficient RAM, and another with verdict 'no'. However, the user's query does not specify which node is relevant; it asks for analysis of a specific error in Gromacs. Since both nodes are present but only one has positive verdict, I need to determine if either provides more accurate information based on their reasons.

The "not enough memory" errors typically occur when there isn't sufficient RAM or swap space available. The first node suggests checking input file sizes and system resources, while the second node doesn't provide specific advice but confirms it's not a critical issue. Both are somewhat relevant, but the first one gives actionable steps (like reducing trajectory length) which aligns with common troubleshooting for memory issues in molecular dynamics simulations.

The user is likely running a large-scale simulation and needs practical solutions to resolve the error. The second node doesn't offer specific advice, so it's less helpful despite having 'yes' verdict? I'll rank them based on relevance and usefulness: first node has higher score because it provides direct troubleshooting steps for memory issues.

However, the user's question does not specify what aspect to compare (e.g., performance vs memory usage), so it might be ambiguous.

The first context node has a verdict 'yes' which indicates that it directly addresses the question by explaining how to use `nvidia-smi` and its functions, including monitoring GPU status and getting detailed info on processes using the GPU. This is highly relevant. The second node with verdict 'no' does not provide any useful information for this query.

However, I am not familiar with this term in the context of technology or programming. It might refer to something specific within a particular domain or perhaps it's a less common acronym. Without more context, it is difficult to determine what exactly they are referring to. The user may have misspelled a word or used an uncommon abbreviation.

Reason: The score is 1.0 because all retrieval contexts are relevant and directly address the user's query about resolving an internal error in VASP related to NB_TOT exceeding NMAX_DEG by providing specific solutions like increasing parameters or recompiling with changes, even though one context mentions a different error (NB_TOT vs NMAX_DEG) but still provides instructions that could be relevant if similar issues exist.

For test case:

  - input: 如何通过命令测试多个节点间的网络连通性?
  - actual output: 通过命令测试多个节点间的网络连通性主要涉及以下几个步骤：首先需要确认节点的状态，例如检查是否有节点被标记为drain状态，并通过命令查询特定原因导致的drain节点列表，同时确认其中的正常节点；其次可以清除节点的dmesg信息以确保没有旧的日志干扰测试结果；最后可以通过具体的网络测试命令来检查节点间的连接状态。1. 使用命令如`yhi -n $drain_nodelist -p ALL`来确认正常开机的节点列表，这有助于排除处于异常状态的节点对测试结果的影响。2. 清除节点的dmesg信息，例如使用`./zni_clean_dmesg_inband.sh`脚本后接节点列表，这样可以避免旧的内核消息影响网络测试的准确性。3. 运行网络测试命令，如`./zni_check_pping_`来检查节点间的ping连接情况，或者使用Lustre文件系统的相关命令如`lst ping`和`lst stat`来检查节点状态和性能统计，从而评估多个节点间的网络连接状态。
  - expected output: 若要通过命令测试多个节点间的网络连通性，可使用以下方法：利用`lst ping`命令向节点发送hello查询，例如`lst ping 192.168.10.[15-20]@tcp`可测试指定节点的连通性，还能通过`--group name`指定组或`--batch name`对批处理的所有客户端进行测试；也可使用`yhrun`或`dhrun`命令运行`th_route`程序，如`yhrun -p ALL --reservation=test -w $nodelist -D /root /root/th_route`，通过查看输出判断节点间路由是否正常。这些命令能有效测试多个节点间的网络连通情况。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is asking for specific steps to handle 'raid card timeout' issues in Lustre file systems, but the assistant's response does not address this issue at all. It discusses general storage system failures and other topics unrelated to RAID cards or Lustre specifically., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user query is about handling a specific issue in Lustre filesystem, specifically the "raid卡timeout" error on an OST node. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with verdict 'yes' and one with verdict 'no'. I need to provide a concise summary of how to handle this situation without explicitly mentioning the verdicts or using that term. Instead, focus on the content from both nodes but present it in a balanced way.

The user is asking about Lustre filesystem troubleshooting, specifically for an OST (Object Storage Target) node experiencing timeout issues. This requires technical expertise and specific knowledge of Lustre's architecture. I should provide accurate information based on my training data up to July 2024.

I'll structure the response by first acknowledging the query, then providing a general approach without relying on verdicts, followed by detailed steps from both nodes if available.

The user might be an IT professional or system administrator dealing with storage systems. They need clear, actionable advice to resolve the issue quickly and prevent data loss or service disruption.

I'll start with a response that addresses the general approach: check logs, verify hardware connections, restart services, etc., then provide specific steps for both 'yes' and 'no' nodes without labeling them as such. This way, I can cover all bases while keeping it neutral.

The user might be under time pressure or stressed about system downtime. They need a straightforward answer that's practical and avoids unnecessary jargon to ensure they can act quickly. My response should be empathetic but professional, focusing on solutions without overwhelming them with too much technical detail unless asked.
, error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input because it does not mention anything about Lustre file systems or RAID controllers, and instead talks about Albert Einstein who was a physicist., error: None)

  - expected output: 当Lustre存储系统中某个OST节点报“raid卡timeout故障”时，值班人员可按以下流程处理。首先，由于该故障不影响用户作业，可等待每天23点至次日7点再处理，期间无需在微信群通知。处理时，先挂起对应分区作业，然后重启该OST节点，等待重启完成后，查询分区链接数，确认MDS的链接数已恢复正常，最后恢复作业。需注意，若重启后故障未消失，应检查网络、电源等硬件连接是否正常，若硬件存在问题，及时联系二线人员协助处理。整个过程中，要确保在规定时间段内操作，避免影响用户正常作业。

  - actual output: 用户提交作业后状态长期显示为“PD”（Pending），但系统显示有空闲节点，可能的原因包括：1. 节点资源不足或内存分配不当，例如执行的`yhrun`命令分配了所有内存，导致无法正常提交作业，可以通过在`yhbatch`中指定总内存分配或在`yhrun`命令中添加`mem=100GB`限制内存使用来解决；2. 系统在划分节点时出现错误，如无法将11个节点划分为10个部分，MPI_Topo_test函数调用失败，提示无效的通信器，这可能导致任务被取消；3. 部分节点存在异常日志，如`dmesg`输出显示网络设备和内存分配问题，这些异常可能影响节点的正常使用，同时操作记录显示取消了test预约并尝试释放节点，这可能也会影响作业的调度和执行。
  - expected output: 用户提交作业后状态长期为“PD”（Pending）但系统显示有空闲节点，可能的原因如下：一是作业请求的资源与空闲节点资源不匹配，如节点内存不足，像运行vasp时若未限制内存，可能因内存分配问题导致作业无法获取资源；二是节点状态异常，虽然显示空闲，但实际存在故障或被标记为drain，如部分节点出现“_wait_tp_dq_empty”等异常日志，影响资源分配；三是作业脚本参数设置不当，例如请求核数过多或未正确设置内存限制，超过节点可用资源；四是系统调度策略影响，可能因分区资源分配规则导致作业排队。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about adding a new VPN user, and the assistant provided an answer that does not address how to add a new VPN user account or configure it properly., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided answer, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about the process for adding a new VPN user, which falls under account management and access control procedures. The first context node (node1) directly addresses this by explaining how to add users in the system, including assigning roles and permissions based on business needs. This matches the query closely. Node2 provides additional information about security considerations but is less specific to adding new users. Node3 discusses general VPN usage which is too broad. Nodes 4-6 are irrelevant as they discuss other topics like firewall configuration and network segmentation unrelated to user authentication or account creation processes., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about VPN user management or adding users to a whitelist, so it cannot be relevant., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 值班人员需为新增VPN用户添加白名单，具体流程是什么？
  - actual output: 值班人员需为新增VPN用户添加白名单的具体流程如下：1. 首先通过Excel文件导入系统用户信息，包括用户名、所属集群、平台、存储分区、组和资源账号等必要字段，仅填写带*的必要字段。2. 将用户添加到平台白名单中，并记录添加时间和操作人员，对于VPN用户无需单独添加，直接将其加入平台白名单即可。3. 选择平台（高性能为hpc_dp，先进制造为am_dp），并确保资源IP段覆盖广泛，同时在资源列表中添加SSH登录权限。4. 如果需要配置OpenVPN客户端，需导入配置文件后连接，当前状态为已连接，连接时使用网页上配置的用户名和密码，支持自动连接。5. 确保数据准确，避免填写错误信息，同时注意日志显示连接成功但部分字符可能出现乱码。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about the available bandwidth and storage space of Lustre file system, but the assistant's response does not provide any information regarding these specifications. The answer should be based on technical knowledge that Lustre is a distributed parallel distributed filesystem designed for high-performance computing environments, typically used in clusters or grids, so it doesn't have fixed hardware requirements like standard disk capacity limits unless specified by the cluster administrators., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user mentioned that Lustre file system uses ZFS, but in reality, Lustre is a distributed file system built on top of various storage backends and typically does not use ZFS or Btrfs as its primary filesystem. It often works with the underlying filesystem like ext4 or XFS depending on configuration., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the available bandwidth and storage capacity of Lustre file systems. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a verdict of 'yes' containing detailed information about I/O performance, scalability, and storage capabilities but not explicitly mentioning bandwidth or capacity limits; another node has verdict 'no'. However, since there is no specific data on available bandwidth in the positive context, it's unclear if that aspect was covered. The negative node does not provide any relevant information regarding these specifications either. Therefore, I cannot definitively confirm the exact figures for Lustre file system availability or capacity without more specific details from the user., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein's birthplace or nationality, and it focuses on his scientific contributions rather than personal details., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Lustre文件系统的可用带宽是多少？可用的文件系统空间是多少？
  - actual output: Lustre文件系统的可用带宽和文件系统空间取决于多个因素，具体如下：1. Lustre文件系统的可用带宽由网络带宽和磁盘带宽的最小值决定，即总带宽等于磁盘带宽和网络带宽的最小值。2. 可用的文件系统空间等于所有OST（对象存储目标）的可用空间总和。3. Lustre通过条带化技术将数据分布到多个OST上，从而提高性能和存储能力，文件可以跨越多个对象进行分割，每个对象可使用多达16 TiB的ldiskfs或256PiB的ZFS，因此实际可用空间取决于所有OST的总可用空间。
  - expected output: Lustre文件系统的可用带宽和可用文件系统空间需根据具体配置确定。其中，可用带宽由网络带宽和磁盘带宽共同决定，通常为两者中的最小值，因为系统总带宽受限于这两个因素中的较低者；而可用的文件系统空间是所有对象存储目标（OST）可用空间的总和，所有OST的可用空间相加即为整个文件系统的可用空间量。

Lustre 文件系统的网络实现作为高性能文件系统，Lustre 文件系统对网络产生了大量的负载。因此,每个 Lustre服务器和客户端的网络接口通常都为文件系统数据交互所用。通常情况下使用专用的TCP/IP 子网，但也可使用其他网络硬件。个典型的 Lustre 文件系统实现可能包括:。Lustre 服务袁的高性能后端网络，通销是 mnfiniBand (IB) 网络。。 一个更庞大的客户端网络。。 连接两个网络的 Lustre rs atLustre 网络和路由配置及管理通过 Lustre 网络 (neb 模块中的/etc/modprobe.d/lustre.conf 配置中指定相关参数。配置 Lustre 网络，要逐一完成以下步骤:1. 识别运行有 Lustre 软件的所有设备和用来进行 Lustre 文件系统交互的网络接口。这些设备将形成 Lustre 网络。网络是一组直接相互通信的节点。Lustre 软件包括 Lustre 网络驱动硕 (LNDs) 以文持各种网络类型和硬件。配置网络的标准规则适用于 Lustre 网络。例如，两个不同子网(tcp0 和tcpl) 上的两个 TCP 网络被认为是两个不同的 Lustre 网络。2. 如果需要路由，请确定要用于路由网络之间的通信的节反。如果您使用多个网络类型 ，那么您将需要一个路由需。任何具有适当接口的节氮都可以在不同的网络硬件类型或拓扑之间为 Lustre 网络', '要用于路由网络之间的通信的节反。如果您使用多个网络类型 ，那么您将需要一个路由需。任何具有适当接口的节氮都可以在不同的网络硬件类型或拓扑之间为 Lustre 网络 (LNeb 数据生成路由 ------WW RA AY以是服务右、客户端或独立路由器。LNet 可将消息路由到不同的网络类型 CM, TCP到 InfiniBand) 或跨越不同的拓扑 〈如桥接两个 mnfiniBand 或TCP/P 网络)。3. 识别网络接口，将其包括在 LNet 内或排除在外。如果没有特别指定，LNet 将使用第一个可用接口或预定义的网络类型作为默认值。LNet 不应该使用的接口〈如管理网络或卫- overIB) 可被排除。包含哪些网络接口或者哪些网络接口排出在外可通过内核模块参数网络 networksAll ip2nets 来指定。4. 为了简化具有复杂网络配置网络的设置，确定一个集群范围的模块配置。对于大型集群，您可以通过在每个节氮上的 lustre.conf 文件配置一个单一的、统一NABER A ATA ABC EI ZA CE59\nLustre 文件系统操作手册 译者:As大注意我们建议您使用 IP 地址而不是主机名，以便增加调试日志的可读性，并且更容易地调试多个接口配置。第六章 Lustre 文件系统上的存储配置注意强烈建议将 Lustre 文件系统的硬件存储配置为RAID。Lustre 软件并不文持文件系统级别的元余，因而需要 RAID 来防御磁盘故障。6.1. 为MDTS 和 OSTs 选择存储设备。Lustre 体系结构允许使用任何类型的块设备作为后端存储。但这些设备的特性差别很大〈苑其是在故隐情况下) ，因此影啊配置的选择。6.1.1 元数据目标 (MDT)在MDT 上的IO 通贡主要是数据的少量读写，因而我们建议您为MDT 存储配置RAID 1。如果您需要的容量比一个磁盘大，我们则建议您配置 RAID 1+ 0或RAID 10。6.1.2 对象存储服务名 (OST)通过下面的快速测算，我们知道如无其他宛余，大型集群应配置为RAID 6 IiiRAID 5 是不可接受的。假设一个2 PB 文件系统', '存储的后备文件系统。这使 Lustre 能够利用 ZFS 的可扩展性和数据完整性特性来实现单个存储目标。“ 符合 POSIX 标准: 完整的POSIX 测试套件以完全相同的方式传递到本地的 ext4文件系统。在集群中，大多数操作都是原子操作，因此客户端永远不会看到损坏的数据或元数据。Lustre 软件文持mmap 0 MPF I/O 操作。.高性能异构网络: Lustre 软件支持各种高性能低延迟的网络，人允许远程直接内存访问 (RDMA) 方式实现在 InfiniBand、IntelOmniPath 等高级网络上的快速高效网络传输。可使用 Lustre 路由桥接多个RDMA 网络以获得最佳性能。Lustre 软件同时也集成了网络诊断。。 高可用性: Lustre 文件系统通过OSTSs (OSS targets) 或者MDT (MDS target) 的共享存储分区实现主动/主动故隐切换。Lustre 文件系统可以与各种高可用性 CHA)管理融一起工作，以实现目动故障切换并消除了单氮故了区 (NSPF) 。这使得应用程序透明恢复成为可能。多重安逆保护 (MMP) 提供了对高可用性系统中的错误的综合保护，和否则将会导致文件系统损坏。可配置多个 MDT 的主动/主动故障切换。这人允许了通过添加 MDT 存储设备和 MDS蔬氮来扩展 Lustre 文件系统的元数据性能。"安全性: 默认情况下，TCP 连接只人允许授权端口通过。UNIX 组成员身份在 MDS上进行验证。“访问控制列表 (ACL) 及扩展属性: Lustre 安全模型遵循 UNIX 文件系统原则，并使用POSIX ACL 进行增强。请注意一些附加功能，如 root squash.“互操作性: Lustre 文件系统运行在各种 CPU 架构和混合端群集上，并在连续发布的一些主要 Lustre 软件版本乙间具有互操作性。“基于对象的体系结构: 客户端与磁盘文件结构相互隔离，可在不影响客户端的情况下升级存储体系结构。33\nLustre 文件系统操作手册 译者: 李硕“字闻粒度文件和细粒度元数据锁定: 许多客户端可以同时读取和修改相同的文件或目录。Lustre 分布式锁管理种 (LDLM) 确保了文件系统中所有客户端和服务融之间的文件是一致', 'J.

Lustre 文件系统条带化Lustre 文件系统高性能的主要原因之一是能够以循环方式跨多个 OST 将数据条素化。用户可根据需要为每个文件配置条市数量，条市大小和 OST。当单个文件的总市宽超过蛙个 OST 的从宽时，可以使用条市化来提高性能。同时，当单个 OST 没有足够的可用空间来容纳整个文件时，条市化也能发挥它的作用。如图下图所示，条齐化允许将文件中的数据段或" 块" 存储在不同的OST 中。在Lustre 文件系统中，通过RAID 0 模式将数据在一定数量的对象上进行条市化。一个文件中处理的对象数称为 stripe_count。每个对象包含文件中的一个数据块，当写入特定对象的数据块超过 stripe_size HY,文件中的下一个数据块将存储在下一个对象上。stripe_count 和 stripe_size 的黑认值由为文件系统设置的，其中，stripe_count 为 1 ，stripe_size 为 1MB。用户可以在每个目录或每个文件上更改这些信。下图中, 文件 C 的 stripe_size 大于文件 A 的 stripe_ size，表明更多的数据被允许存储在文件 C 的单个条帝中。文件A 的 stripe_count 为3，则数据在三个对过上条带化。文件B 和文件 C 的 stripe_count 是 1。OST 上没有为未写入的数据预留空间。39\nFile A data [|File B data [|File C data [图 5: Lustre cluster at scale最大文件大小不受单个目标大小的限制。在 Lustre 文件系统中，文件可以跨越多个对象 GRA 2000 个', '多种网络类型© 不同网络间的路由LNet 允许各种不同网络互连间的端到端读/写吞吐量达到或接近峰值带宽速率。eit2.3.Lustre 网络Lustre 网络由运行 Lustre 软件的客户端和服务器组成。它不局限于一个 LNet 子网，只要网络之间可以进行路由，它可以跨越多个网络。类似地，一个单独的网络可以包含多个 LNet 子网。Lustre 网络推栈由两层组成: LNet 代码模块和 LND。LNet 层在 LND 层之上操作，其方式类似于网络层在数据链路层之上操作。LNet 层是无连接的、异步的，不进行传输数据验证。LND 层是面问和连接，通痢进行数据传输验证。LNets 通过唯一的标签进行标识，该标签为对应的 LND 和一个数字组成的字符串，如 tcp0、o2ib0、o2ib1。LNet 上的每个和点至少有一个网络标识符 (NID) ，由网络接口地址和 LNet 标签组成，形式为: *address*@*LNet label*.例如:1 192.168.1.2@tcp0d2 10.13.24.908o2ib1在革些情况下，Lustre 文件系统流量可能需要在多个 LNets 之间传递，这就需要用到 LNet 路由。请注意，LNet 路由不同于网络路由。2.4. 支持的网络类型LNet 代码模块所包含的 LNDs 支持以下网络类型 :。 InfiniBand: OpenFabrics OFED (02ib)° TCP (包括 GigE, 10GigE, IPoIB 等在内的所有 TCP 流量的网络)¢ RapidArray: ra* Quadrics: Elan4]\nLustre 文件系统操作手册这ay第三章 Lustre 文件系统的故障切换3.1. 什么是故障切换在高可用的 CHA) 系统中，通过使用元余硬软件，并利用故障时可目动恢复的软件，来最大限度地减少计划外停机时间。当出现服务需或存储设备丢失、网络或软件故隐时，系统服务将在最小的中断时间后继续运行。通希，可用性通过系统处在可工作状态的时间比例来衡量。可用性通过硬件和 或) 软件的副本来实现。这样，当主服务需发生故障或不可用时，备用服务需将进行切换，以运行应用和相关资源。该故障切换的过程在', '.2 对象存储服务名 (OST)通过下面的快速测算，我们知道如无其他宛余，大型集群应配置为RAID 6 IiiRAID 5 是不可接受的。假设一个2 PB 文件系统 (2000 个容量为1TB 的磁盘) 的磁盘平均故障时间 (MT TF )为 1000 天。这意味痢失败率的期望值是 2000/1000 = 2 个磁往/天。10% 的磁盘市宽的修复时间则是 1000 GB/10 MB per sec = 100,000 秒，也就是大约 1K.而对于一个含 10 个磁盘的RAID S，在重建的1 天当中，相同阵列中的第二个磁盘失败的几率大约是 9/1000 或每天 1%。50 天之后，RAID 5 阵列则有 50% 的几率出现双重故障，导致数据丢失。因此，配置RAID 6 或其他的双重奇偶校验算法来提供足够的元余来存储 OST 非常必要为了获得更好的性能，我们建议您使用4个或8 个数据磁盘和一个或两个奇偶磁盘来创建 RAID 阵列。相比较拥有多个独立的RAID 阵列，使用更大的 RAID 阵列将会对性能造成负面影响。为最大化小规模 IO 请求的性能，存储可配置为RAID 1+0，但同时这将增加成本、降低容量。60\nLustre 文件系统操作手册 译者:As大6.2. 可靠性为增强可靠性，我们建议: (AY RAID 监控软件以快速检测出故障的磁盘，并及时将其替换从而避免双重故障和数据丢失; 使用热备份磁盘，以避免重建时的延迟。我们还建议及时备份文件系统的元数据。6.3. 性能权衡在写操作不是全条带宽度的情况下，回写 RAID 存储控制的缓存可极大地提高多种RAID 阵列的写性能。不笠的是，除非 RAID 阵列配备的缓存有电池文持 (只有在一些价格较高的硬件 RAID 阵列中才文持)，否则阵列的电源中断可能会导致无序写入或写丢失，或者奇偶校验损坏或元数据损坏，从而导致数据丢失。MDS 或 0SS ace hy) PCI 适配夯卡上如宁有板载读或']

  - input: 某用户作业因“forrtl: severe (41): insufficient virtual memory”报错中断，可能的原因及解决方法是什么？
  - actual output: 用户作业因“forrtl: severe (41): insufficient virtual memory”报错中断，可能的原因及解决方法如下：1. 可能原因是内存资源不足，系统日志显示多次出现“GLEX create region failed: no enough memory resources”错误，表明内存资源不足，随后发生MPI通信错误，导致任务被终止，最终因内存不足，程序在执行能量最小化时崩溃，提示“Not enough memory. Failed to realloc...”，解决方法为优化资源分配或减少并发数。2. 可能原因是Linux系统对内存的过量分配机制（overcommit），在使用`os.fork()`创建子进程时，虽然物理内存未满，但虚拟地址空间可能被耗尽，导致OOM错误，解决方案包括调整`/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`参数或改用多线程程序。3. 可能原因是内存溢出，用户运行Fortran程序时出现“Segmentation fault - invalid memory reference”错误，经排查为内存溢出导致，解决方案是在编译时添加-g选项，并使用valgrind工具检查内存泄漏，编译命令为：gfortran Matrix.f90 -L/vol6/software/libraries/lapack/3.8.0-gcc49/lib64 -llapack -lblas -g，随后运行valgrind进行内存检查。
  - expected output: 用户作业因“forrtl: severe (41): insufficient virtual memory”报错中断，可能是由虚拟内存不足导致。一方面，程序申请的虚拟内存超过系统可用范围，像多进程程序创建子进程时，每个进程都需分配虚拟地址空间，若总需求超过系统限制就会报错；另一方面，系统内存分配策略（overcommit）也可能引发问题，Linux默认允许内存过量使用，当申请的虚拟内存超过实际可分配范围时，就会出现该错误。解决该问题可从以下两方面着手：一是调整系统内存分配策略，系统管理员可修改`/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`参数，将其设为1，采用无内存过量使用处理策略，以增强大量使用内存任务的性能；二是优化程序资源分配，若程序使用多进程，可考虑将其修改为多线程程序，避免因多进程创建导致虚拟内存过度分配，同时，用户在提交作业时，也应合理设置进程数和内存请求，避免资源过度申请。

  - input: Lustre文件系统的故障切换功能有几种？请详细说明。
  - actual output: Lustre文件系统的故障切换功能主要分为MDT故障切换和OST故障切换两种，具体配置方式包括主动/被动和主动/主动模式，这些功能需要依赖外部高可用性（HA）软件来实现。1. MDT故障切换配置包括主动/被动和主动/主动两种模式，主动/被动模式下两个MDS节点共享存储，主MDS负责管理元数据资源，当主MDS故障时，备用MDS接管服务；主动/主动模式下每个MDS管理不同的元数据子集，提高可用性。2. OST故障切换配置允许为一个OST配置多个OSS节点，但一次只有一个OSS提供服务，通过umount/mount命令可以移动OST到备用节点，使用mkfs.lustre或tunefs.lustre命令指定服务节点以实现故障转移。3. 故障切换功能需要依赖HA软件如Corosync和Pacemaker，以及电源管理工具如PowerMan或STONITH，这些工具负责资源屏蔽、资源管理和健康监控，确保故障切换过程安全可靠，避免数据损坏。此外，Lustre本身不提供数据冗余，需依赖存储设备的冗余能力，如RAID 1、RAID 10或RAID 6。
  - expected output: Lustre文件系统的故障切换功能主要依赖外部高可用性（HA）软件实现，其故障切换配置类型及说明如下：1、主动/被动模式：在该模式下，主动节点提供资源和数据，被动节点处于闲置状态。当主动节点发生故障时，被动节点会接管资源，为MDT或OST提供服务。例如，为一个MDT配置两个MDS节点，正常情况下仅一个MDS节点为MDT提供服务，若其故障，另一个MDS节点会接管。2、主动/主动模式：此模式中，两个节点同时处于活跃状态，共同承担工作。当其中一个节点故障时，另一个节点会接管其资源。如为多个MDT分区配置两个MDS节点，每个MDS节点负责部分MDT的服务，若其中一个MDS节点故障，另一个会为所有MDT提供服务。此外，故障切换功能的实现需要借助外部HA软件（如Corosync和Pacemaker）来完成节点监视、故障检测和资源保护等操作，同时还需要远程电源控制机制（如IPMI/BMC设备）来确保故障节点被正确关闭，避免数据损坏。

The answer should have been more detailed in explaining the process., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided answer, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about how to regenerate Lustre configuration logs. The retrieval contexts provided include information on generating and managing configuration files, but do not specifically address the process of regenerating or resetting logs in a clear manner. There might be some related content about modifying configurations, but it does not explicitly mention regeneration steps for logs. Therefore, I cannot confirm that any node has directly addressed the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein's birthplace or nationality, so it is irrelevant to the question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何重新生成Lustre配置日志？说明具体流程。
  - actual output: 重新生成Lustre配置日志的具体流程包括卸载客户端、运行特定命令、重新挂载目标以及确保操作顺序正确。1. 卸载文件系统上的所有客户端，确保没有活动的连接或数据访问。2. 在每个服务器上运行 tunefs.lustre --writeconf 命令，该命令会重新生成配置日志并更新目标磁盘上的配置信息。3. 挂载 MDT 和 OST，确保目标设备正确加载新的配置。4. 最后，挂载客户端，使更改生效并恢复文件系统的正常操作。在整个过程中，必须严格按照操作顺序执行，避免因操作不当导致文件系统无法使用或数据丢失。此外，在执行此操作前应备份重要数据，并确保所有客户端已正确卸载。
  - expected output: 重新生成Lustre配置日志需按以下流程操作：首先，卸载文件系统上的所有客户端，确保没有用户在使用该文件系统；接着，卸载所有的MDT和OST，使相关存储目标处于非挂载状态；然后，在每个服务器上运行`tunefs.lustre --writeconf`命令，此操作会擦除此MDT所属文件系统的所有配置日志并重新生成；之后，重新挂载MDT和OST，恢复存储目标的挂载状态；最后，挂载客户端，使文件系统重新可供用户使用。需要注意的是，此操作具有一定危险性，务必在执行前完成卸载客户端和停止服务器服务的操作，且在重新启动所有目标之前，不要启动任何客户端。

However, based on typical behavior of the 'execute' command in Kubernetes, it typically shows execution details and output from the executed command., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is low because there are clear contradictions between the claim and the retrieved information., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about the output of a command, and the retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' which directly addresses the question. The other context has verdict 'no'. However, the score is 1.0, indicating that all retrieved nodes are relevant or not? Wait, no: the score is calculated as (number of yes - number of no) / total, so if there's one yes and one no, then it would be (1-0)/2 = 0.5, but wait let me check the example again., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about YHWH or its control mechanisms, and instead focuses on Einstein's personal life and scientific achievements which are unrelated to the query., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking for a concise explanation of the 'yhcontrol' parameter, but there are multiple possible interpretations due to ambiguity. The term 'yhcontrol' could refer to different things depending on context; it might be a misspelling or abbreviation. Without additional context, it's unclear what specific system or tool this refers to., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval result has high precision because it includes contexts that are highly relevant to controlling job partitions and system configurations related to job scheduling. The first context is about yhcontrol parameters for job control, the second one mentions updating job specifications with a parameter similar to account management (Account=accountname), and the third discusses node configuration in HPC environments which can be linked to job scheduling systems like Slurm where nodes are managed. However, there might be some tangential relevance as all three contexts touch upon system administration aspects but not directly on Nobel Prizes or winning them., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4166666666666667, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide any information about Albert Einstein's personal life, birth details, or direct contributions to quantum mechanics; instead, it focuses on unrelated topics like command-line commands and other scientific concepts., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何利用ZFS快照实现LUSTRE文件系统的卷级备份迁移？
  - actual output: 利用ZFS快照实现LUSTRE文件系统的卷级备份迁移需要遵循一系列步骤，确保数据的完整性和一致性。首先需要确认目标卷的信息，包括存储设备是否由ZFS创建、存储池名称以及迁移的数据集。接着卸载所有的LUSTRE文件系统客户端和目标卷，以避免在备份过程中发生数据变化。然后生成需要备份的ZFS数据集的快照，这一步是关键，因为快照能够捕获数据集在某一时间点的状态，为后续的备份提供可靠的基础。准备一套新的存储设备，并将其连接到服务器上，使用ZFS进行配置并挂载到当前服务器或另一台服务器。接下来可以选择两种方法之一进行备份迁移：通用备份恢复方法和单独备份方法。通用备份恢复方法通过zfs send发送快照，并使用zfs recv接收，这种方法执行速度快，适合大规模数据迁移；而单独备份方法则是将快照打包为压缩包，适用于小规模数据或特定需求。在完成数据迁移后，需要检查新生成的目标卷的配置，确保其与原目标卷一致，并刷新目标卷及其他存储卷的配置。最后重新挂载所有LUSTRE存储卷，等待文件系统恢复正常状态，挂载LUSTRE客户端进行数据验证和IOR测试，确认无数据丢失且IO正常后，迁移完成，新存储可正常使用。1. 确认目标卷信息，包括存储设备是否由ZFS创建、存储池名称及迁移的数据集。2. 卸载所有LUSTRE文件系统客户端和目标卷，避免数据变化。3. 生成ZFS数据集的快照，确保数据的一致性。4. 准备新的存储设备并进行配置和挂载。5. 使用zfs send和zfs recv进行数据迁移，或打包备份进行恢复。6. 检查新生成的目标卷配置，确保与原卷一致。7. 刷新目标卷及其他存储卷的配置。8. 重新挂载所有LUSTRE存储卷并进行数据验证和IOR测试。
  - expected output: 利用ZFS快照实现LUSTRE文件系统的卷级备份迁移，首先要确认目标卷存储设备是由ZFS创建的存储池，明确存储池名称和迁移的数据集，可通过`df -t lustre`查看目标卷挂载时使用的数据集，接着将所有LUSTRE文件系统客户端和目标卷卸载，包括client、ost、mdt及mgs等，然后使用`zfs snapshot <数据集>@<快照标记名称>`命令生成快照并通过`zfs list -t snapshot`查看，之后将新存储连接到服务器，用ZFS进行配置挂载或连接到另一台服务器并使用ZFS导入，再使用`mkfs.lustre --reformat --fsname=<fsname> --replace <原存储配置参数> <新zfs数据集>`命令对新存储设备格式化，备份迁移可选择通用备份恢复方法，即使用`zfs send`发送快照再用`zfs recv`接收，跨服务器备份时通过管道加ssh实现，也可选择单独备份方法将存储池备份打包为压缩包，恢复时用`zfs recv`导入，完成后使用`tunefs.lustre <目标卷>`获取配置信息与原目标卷对比，确保配置相同，再执行`tunefs.lustre writeconf <目标卷>`刷新目标卷配置并刷新其他所有存储卷的配置，最后重新挂载所有LUSTRE存储卷，等待文件系统恢复正常后挂载LUSTRE客户端，检查数据是否丢失并进行IOR测试，确认文件系统IO正常后新存储即可正常使用。

For test case:

  - input: 如何在现存的Lustre文件系统中添加一个OST？
  - actual output: 在现存的Lustre文件系统中添加一个OST，需要按照以下步骤进行：1. 使用mkfs.lustre命令添加新的OST。当文件系统第一次进行格式化时，可以使用mkfs.lustre命令添加新的OST，每个新的OST必须有一个唯一的索引，可以通过lctl dl命令查看所有OST的列表。例如，添加一个新的OST至testfs文件系统，索引为12，命令为oss# mkfs.lustre --fsname=testfs --mgsnode=mdsl6@tcp0 --ost --index=12 /dev/sda。2. 挂载新的OST。添加新的OST后，需要创建挂载点并挂载该OST。例如，创建目录/mnt/testfs/ost12，并使用mount命令挂载/dev/sda到该目录。3. 平衡OST空间使用。当新的空白OST添加到相对拥挤的文件系统时，可能导致文件系统的不平衡，但新创建的文件会优先放置在新的空白OST上，从而自动平衡文件系统的使用量。如果需要进一步平衡，可以使用lfs migrate命令重新分配旧文件。4. 恢复OST配置。如果配置文件不可用，可以从其他OST复制mountdata文件，并通过dd命令恢复到新的OST的CONFIGS目录中。5. 重新激活OST。如果OST暂时不可用，需要在MGS和客户端上重新激活它，使用lctl set param命令设置相关参数。6. 确保OST的可用性。如果OST永久不可用，需要在MGS配置中重新激活它，使用lctl conf param命令设置相关参数。7. 验证OST状态。通过lctl命令检查OST的状态，确保其正常运行并被正确识别。8. 测试IO性能。在添加OST后，测试客户端的IO性能，确保负载均衡和整体性能达到预期。9. 监控和维护。定期监控OST的使用情况和性能，及时处理可能出现的问题，确保文件系统的稳定运行。10. 备份配置。在进行任何操作前，建议备份现有的配置文件，以防万一需要恢复。11. 注意事项。在添加OST时，确保所有操作符合Lustre文件系统的最佳实践，避免因配置错误导致数据丢失或性能下降。12. 文档记录。详细记录添加OST的过程和配置，便于后续管理和故障排查。13. 培训和准备。确保相关人员了解添加OST的流程和注意事项，提高操作的准确性和效率。14. 测试环境验证。在生产环境实施前，先在测试环境中验证添加OST的步骤和效果，确保万无一失。15. 后续优化。根据实际使用情况，对OST的配置和管理进行持续优化，提升整体存储性能和可靠性。
  - expected output: 在现存的Lustre文件系统中添加一个OST，可按以下步骤操作：首先，使用`lctl dl`查看所有OST的列表，确定可用索引，例如要添加索引为12的OST到testfs文件系统，执行`oss# mkfs.lustre --fsname=testfs --mgsnode=mdsl6@tcp0 --ost --index=12 /dev/sda`；接着，创建挂载目录`oss# mkdir -p /mnt/testfs/ost12`，并将新OST挂载到该目录`oss# mount -t lustre /dev/sda /mnt/testfs/ost12`；添加完成后，若文件系统中已有OST空间使用不均衡，可使用`lfs migrate`命令重新平衡文件分布，比如`client# lfs migrate /mnt/lustre/dir`可重新平衡指定目录下的文件，`client# lfs find /test --ost test-OST0004 -size +4G | lfs migrate -y`可将特定OST上大于4GB的文件迁移至其他OST，以实现空间的均衡使用。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about how to use a command related to triggers, but it seems there might be a typo or incomplete context. The term 'yhtrigger' appears to be misspelled; the correct term should likely be 'Yunhai trigger', which refers to a specific feature in Huawei devices for triggering YOLO models with an API call. However, the user's question is not clear about what exactly they are asking - whether it's about setting up triggers or creating a trigger condition. The answer provided does not address this ambiguity and instead focuses on general information about 'yhtrigger' which doesn't exist in standard contexts, leading to irrelevance., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output does not contradict any information in the retrieval context; however, there is a discrepancy regarding the command name: retrieval mentions yhtrigger while actual says yhtrigger. This might be a typo or miscommunication but no contradiction exists if we consider it as such. The score remains 0.5., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about how to set triggers using the command line, which aligns with the query's intent regarding configuration or setup of triggers. The node labeled as node_1024 provides detailed instructions on setting up a trigger via CLI commands, including the specific 'yhtrigger--set' command and its usage examples. This is directly relevant to the user's question about using a command to set triggers., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5555555555555556, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about YHOO stock or its financial performance, market trends, or related topics., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 哪些用户可以通过yhtrigger--set [OPTIONS]命令设置触发器？
  - actual output: yhtrigger --set [OPTIONS]命令用于设置触发器，只有特定的用户才能使用该命令。根据提供的信息，只有SlurmUser用户才能设置触发器，这是为了确保slurmctld控制进程能够为所执行的动作程序设置用户和组。此外，设置触发器的用户权限可能还受到系统配置的限制。综述如下：1. SlurmUser用户可以设置触发器，这是默认的限制条件；2. 如果SlurmUser被设置为Root，则可能允许其他用户设置触发器；3. 触发器动作程序在管理节点上执行，而不是计算节点，因此用户的权限可能与管理节点的访问权限相关。
  - expected output: 除非 SlurmUser 设置为 root，否则只有SlurmUser用户可以通过yhtrigger--set [OPTIONS]命令设置触发器。SlurmUser通常是系统中具有特定权限的用户，用于确保触发器操作的安全性和可控性。若要确认SlurmUser的具体设置，可执行yhcontrol show config | grep SlurmUser命令进行查看。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['yhtrigger 是一个用于在资源管理系统中设置和管理触发器的工具，当特定事件发生时（如节点状态变化、作业结束等），可以执行预定义的动作，如运行脚本。触发器通过周期性检查（默认15秒）来处理事件，并且需要在下一个周期前重新设置以避免丢失事件。触发器可以基于节点状态、作业状态、时间限制等条件设置，且动作程序在管理节点上执行。用户可通过命令行选项查看、设置和删除触发器，同时支持多种事件类型和参数配置。yhacctmgr 则用于查看和修改帐号信息，基于用户、集群、分区和帐号的关联记录进行操作。', 'yhbatch 是用于提交批处理作业的命令，支持多种选项来控制作业的资源分配、执行方式和依赖关系。例如，--overcommit 允许每个处理器运行多个任务，-o 指定输出文件，--partition 选择资源分区，--time 设置运行时间限制，-p 指定分区，--dependency 定义作业依赖关系等。此外，还支持资源限制传递、作业重新排队、节点共享、临时磁盘空间设置等功能。环境变量也可用于设置选项，且命令行选项优先级高于环境变量。', 'The yhshare command is used to display job scheduling priority factors when using the priority/multifactor plugin. It is read-only and retrieves information from the scheduler plugin. By default, it shows information for all queued jobs, but options can be used to view specific jobs or users. Options include displaying normalized priority factors, customizing output format, and showing weights of priority factors. The yhstat command displays status information for running jobs or job steps, including CPU, memory, and other metrics.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not directly address the user's question about the difference between MDT and OST. It only describes what an LLM is, which is unrelated to the topic of MFT (MIME Format Type) or any other specific technology mentioned in the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because there are some contradictions in the claim and the retrieved context.

First contradiction: The claim states that 'OST' refers to a system responsible for metadata management, but the retrieval context does not mention any role of OST in metadata handling; it only mentions that files are stored on OSTs (Outlook Offline Storage Files) which is a different function. Second contradiction: The claim says 'OST manages file data', while the retrieved text states that data is read from OST by MFT, so there might be an ambiguity or lack of clarity regarding who actually handles the management., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the distinction between MDT and OST, which are both related to medical imaging techniques. The first node mentions that MDT (Micro-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test) is a test used for diagnosing Cushing's syndrome by measuring cortisol levels after administering low-dose dexamethasine. This does not directly address the user's question about MDT and OST, but it provides some related information about a medical test involving steroids., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about MDT and OST or their relationship, only mentions Albert Einstein and his work on relativity., error: None)

For test case:

  - input:  MDT 与 OST 有什么区别？二者如何协作完成 I/O 操作？
  - actual output: MDT（元数据目标）和OST（对象存储目标）在Lustre文件系统中承担不同的角色，MDT主要负责存储文件系统的元数据，如文件的属性、目录结构等，而OST则负责实际的数据存储，处理文件的数据块。MDT和OST协作完成I/O操作的方式如下：1.MDT负责管理文件的元数据，当客户端请求访问文件时，首先通过MDS（元数据服务器）查询MDT获取文件的元数据信息，包括文件存储在哪些OST上。2.一旦确定文件存储的OST位置，客户端直接与相应的OST进行数据交互，读取或写入数据。3.在写入数据时，客户端将数据分片并分布到多个OST上，确保数据的并行处理和负载均衡，提高整体性能。4.在读取数据时，客户端从多个OST上同时读取数据块，并在客户端进行合并，以加快数据传输速度。5.MDT和OST之间的通信通过Lustre的网络协议实现，确保元数据和数据的高效传输。6.当需要扩展存储容量时，可以添加新的MDT或OST，通过调整文件系统的配置，使新设备参与I/O操作，提升系统的整体性能和可靠性。7.MDT和OST的管理和维护也相互关联，例如在移除或恢复MDT/OST时，需要确保元数据和数据的一致性，避免数据丢失或损坏。8.在某些情况下，如OST出现故障或需要维护，可以通过设置不活跃状态来防止新文件写入，同时迁移数据或从备份恢复，确保系统的稳定运行。9.MDT和OST的配置和优化对整个文件系统的性能有重要影响，例如合理分配负载、选择合适的存储硬件和RAID配置等，都能有效提升I/O操作的效率和可靠性。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，MDT（元数据目标）与OST（对象存储目标）在功能和职责上存在明显区别且相互协作完成I/O操作。MDT主要负责存储和管理文件系统的元数据，像文件名、目录结构、权限及文件布局等信息，类似“文件索引”，其存储需求较小但可靠性要求高，常采用RAID1等镜像配置，还可通过DNE特性将目录分散到多个MDT以避免负载过高；OST则用于存储实际的文件数据，以对象形式分布在多个存储目标上，存储容量为所有目标总和，需根据数据总量规划空间，采用RAID-6等配置提升可靠性，新文件会优先分配到空闲OST并通过工具平衡空间使用。在协作完成I/O操作时，用户发起请求后，MDT先查询文件元数据信息并返回给客户端，客户端据此直接与对应的OST通信进行数据读写，同时MDT管理OST状态，若某OST故障或负载过高会调整分配策略，确保I/O操作顺利进行。

For test case:

  - input:  Jobstats作业I/O统计功能，如何通过参数调整其自动清理策略？实际应用中为什么需要调整？
  - actual output: Jobstats作业I/O统计功能通过参数调整其自动清理策略主要涉及设置job_cleanup_interval参数，该参数决定了作业统计信息在未被激活状态下的保留时间。用户可以通过临时或永久性更改此参数来调整自动清理策略。例如，使用命令“lctl set param *.*.job cleanup interval={max_age}”可以临时更改时间值，而使用“lctl conf param testfs.mdt.job cleanup interval=700”则可以永久性地将job_cleanup_interval设置为700秒。此外，将job_cleanup_interval设置为0可以禁用自动清理功能。实际应用中需要调整自动清理策略的原因包括：1. 避免内存占用过高，因为如果启用了自动清理功能，所有统计信息会永久保存在内存中，可能导致内存被完全占用；2. 根据具体需求优化性能监控，例如在长时间运行的作业中可能需要更长的统计信息保留时间以进行详细分析；3. 确保监控工具在处理作业统计数据时能够有效管理数据，避免因数据过多而影响系统性能。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，Jobstats作业I/O统计功能的自动清理策略可通过参数进行调整，实际应用中调整策略主要基于内存管理和数据保留需求。具体来看：1. 调整参数的方法包括，临时调整可通过`lctl set param *.*.job_cleanup_interval={max_age}`命令，永久调整则使用`lctl conf param testfs.mdt.job_cleanup_interval=700`（如设置为700秒），若将`job_cleanup_interval`设为0可禁用自动清理；2. 实际应用中需要调整是因为，若不启用自动清理，统计信息会持续占用内存，可能导致服务器内存耗尽，而合理设置清理时间能在保留必要统计数据的同时释放无效数据占用的资源，比如长时间运行的作业可延长清理时间，内存紧张时则缩短清理时间以优化系统性能。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking about controlling log collection in a specific way, and the assistant provided an answer that does not address this topic at all. The response is completely off-topic and fails to provide any relevant information or guidance on the subject., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates that there might be some inconsistencies or discrepancies between the model's response and the provided context, but it does not necessarily mean a contradiction exists; it could reflect uncertainty or partial alignment., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about how to use the `changelog_mask` feature in Lustre file systems for fine-grained control over changelog logging. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict ('yes') and another with a negative verdict ('no'). However, the 'reasons' field in both nodes contains placeholder text or incomplete information (e.g., '...'), which limits the ability to assess their relevance fully. Since there is no specific content from retrieval contexts provided for the 'no' node, it's unclear what exactly constitutes an irrelevant context here. The user seems to be asking about a technical configuration aspect of Lustre filesystems, specifically regarding changelog management and its impact on performance or functionality in high-performance computing environments. This requires detailed information not available in the given retrieval contexts., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6206896551724138, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not directly relevant to the user's query about Lustre file system configuration or management, as it focuses on general concepts and historical facts unrelated to specific Lustre configuration details., error: None)

For test case:

  - input:  Lustre文件系统如何通过设置 changelog_mask 精细控制Changelog日志的采集范围？在哪些场景下需要这样做？
  - actual output: Lustre文件系统通过设置changelog_mask参数可以精细控制Changelog日志的采集范围，该参数允许用户指定需要记录的操作类型，从而过滤掉不需要的日志条目，减少日志量并提高效率。在具体操作中，可以通过lctl命令来获取和设置changelog_mask的值，例如使用“lctl set param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_mask=HLINK”来仅记录硬链接操作的Changelog。1. 设置changelog_mask可以通过lctl命令实现，用户可以根据需求选择特定的操作类型进行记录，如CREAT、MKDIR、HLINK等，这样可以避免记录不必要的操作，节省存储空间和系统资源。2. 在实际应用中，某些场景下需要对Changelog日志的采集范围进行精细控制，例如在高负载的生产环境中，为了减少日志对系统性能的影响，可以只记录关键操作；或者在进行系统调试时，仅关注特定类型的操作以快速定位问题。3. 此外，在审计或安全监控场景中，可能需要根据合规性要求，只记录特定类型的文件系统操作，以满足审计需求或防止敏感信息泄露。因此，设置changelog_mask能够帮助用户更灵活地管理Changelog日志，适应不同的使用场景和需求。
  - expected output: Lustre文件系统通过设置changelog_mask可精细控制Changelog日志的采集范围，具体如下：1. 通过`lctl set param mdd.<设备名>.changelog_mask`命令，可设置需要记录的操作类型，如`MARK CREAT MKDIR`等，多个操作类型用空格分隔，也可通过`-操作类型`排除特定操作；2. 在需要审计关键操作的场景，如金融数据修改、科研数据变更等，通过设置changelog_mask仅记录创建、删除、重命名等核心操作，便于追溯；3. 当MDT存储空间紧张时，可通过changelog_mask过滤掉如属性修改等非必要操作，减少日志存储占用；4. 进行系统调试时，设置changelog_mask聚焦特定操作类型，如链接创建、文件关闭等，方便分析相关功能的运行逻辑和故障定位。

文件系统层面的故障切换机制，但没有提供完整的故障切换解雇方案。一般来说，完整的故障切换解雇方案会为失效的系统级别组件提供故障切换功能，例如切换失效的硬件或应用，甚至切换失效的整个节点。但是 Lustre 没有提供这部分功能。诸如节点监视、故障检测和资源保护等故障切换功能必须由外部 HA 软件提供，例如 PowerMan，或由 Linux 操作系统供应商提供的开源 Corosync 和 Pacemaker软件包。其中，Corosync 提供了检测故障的文持，Pacemaker 则在检测到故障后采取行动。11.1.1 选择电源设备Lustre 文件系统中的故障切换需要使用远程电源控制 (Remote Power Control, RPC)机制，它具有多种配置。例如，Lustre 服务器节点可能配备了文持远程电源控制的IPMI/BMC

Lustre 文件系统故障切换的准备工作为使 Pustre 文件系统其具备高可用性，我们通过第三方 HA 应用程序对其进行配置和管理。每个存储目标 (MGT, MGS, OST) 都必须与另一个备用节点相关联，以创建故障切换对。当客户端挂载文件系统时，此配置信息由 MGS 传送给客户端在挂载存储目标时，其配置信息会转发 MGS。与此相关的一些规则是;。初次挂载目标时，MGS 从目标读取配置信息 〈诸如 mgt vs. ost, failnode, fsname) ，并将该存储目标配置到 Lustre 文件系统上。如果 MGS 是首次读取到这一挂载配置，则该节点将成为该存储目标的" 主" 节点。。再次挂载目标时，MGS 从目标读取当前配置，并根据需要重新配置 MGS 数据库里的目标信息使用mkfs .1ustre命令格式化目标时，通过--servicenode选项来指定目标的故障切换服务节氮。在下面的示例中，文件系统 testfs 中编号为0 的 OST 被格式化，两个服务节点被指定成该 OST 的故障切换对:mkfs.lustre —-reformat --ost --fsname testfs --mgsnode=192.168.10.1@o03ib \\--index=0 —-servicenode=192.168.10.7@o2ib \\-—-servicenode=192.168.10.8@o2ib \\/dev/sdb106\nLustre 文件系统', "lctl 命令在MDT 节Fa _ETEM当所有 changelog 用户处理完成了某个节点之前的记录时，记录被完全删除。12.1.1.4 Lect1 changelog deregister 注销 changelog 用户 ，请运行:lctl --device mdt_ device changelog deregister useridchangelog deregister cll 在完成注销操作时，相当于快速执行了 lfs changelog clearcll 0 命令。12.1.2 Changelogs 命令示例以下是一些不同的 Changelogs 命令的示例。 注册 Changelog 用户为某个设备 (lustre-MDT0000) 注册一个新的 Changelog HF:mds# lJctl --device lustre-MDT0000 changelog registerlustre-MDTO000: Registered changelog userid ‘'cll'。 显示 Changelog 记录在MDT 上显示 Changelog 记录 :S lfs changelog lustre-MDTO0001 O2MKDIR 15:15:21.977666834 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402: 0x1:0x0] ef=Oxf \\u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000007: 0x1:0x0] pics2 O1CREAT 15:15:36.687592024 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402: 0x2:0x0] ef=Oxf \\u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402: 0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg3 O6UNLNK 15:15:41.305116815 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402: 0x2:0x0] ef=Oxf \\u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402: 0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg4 O7RMDIR 15:15:46.468790091 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402: 0x1:0x0] ef=Oxf \\u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000007: 0x1:0x0] picsChangelog 记录包含了如下信息:LeCHoperation type (numerical/text)timestampdatestamp111\nLustre 文件系统操作手册%my这ay5 flags6 t=target FID7 ef-extended_flags8 u=uid:gid9 nid=client NID10 p=parent FID11 target name显示格式为:—rec# operation type", "my这ay5 flags6 t=target FID7 ef-extended_flags8 u=uid:gid9 nid=client NID10 p=parent FID11 target name显示格式为:—rec# operation type (numerical/text) timestamp datestamp flags t=target FID \\2 ef=extended_flags u-uid:gid nid-client NID p=parent_FID target name如:2 O1CREAT 15:15:36.687592024 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402: 0x2:0x0] ef=Oxf \\—2 u=500:500 nic=10.128.11.159%@tcp p=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg。 清除 Changelog 记录通知设备某个特定用户 (cll) 已经不需要相关记录 (3 及3 之前的):$ lfs changelog clear lustre-MDT0000 cll 3确认 changelog clear 操作成功，运行 Ifs changelog。我们看到只显示了 id-3 以后的SA:S lfs changelog lustre-MDTO000—2 4 O7RMDIR 15:15:46.468790091 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402: 0x1:0x0] ef=Oxf \\ULDu=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159%tcp p=[0x200000007:0x1:0x0] pics。 注销 Changelog 4在革个设备上 (lustre-MDRO000) 注销革个 Changelog 用户 (cll):1 mds# lctl --device lustre-MDT0000 changelog deregister cll2 lustre-MDTOO00: Deregistered changelog user 'cll'注销操作清除了该用户所有 Changelog 记录。1 $ 1Lfs changelog Lustre-MDT00002 5 OOMARK 15:56:39.603643887 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x20001: 0x0: 0x0] ef=Oxf \\3 u=500:500 nid=0@<0:0> p=[0:0x50:0xb] mdd_obd-lustre-MDT0000-0注意MARK 记录表明了 Changelog 记录状态变化。112\n——ULDNn—ULDNn—ULDLustre 文件系统操作手册 译者:这ay”显示 Changelog"]

For test case:

  - input: 如何理解和应用 dom_stripesize 参数？它在启用Data-onMDT（DoM）特性时起到什么作用？
  - actual output: dom_stripesize 参数是Lustre文件系统中用于控制DoM（Directory of Metadata）文件最大条带大小的重要配置参数，其作用和应用方式如下：1. dom_stripesize 参数的作用是限制DoM文件在MDT上的最大组件大小，防止MDT被大文件填满，从而保障系统的稳定性和性能。该参数的默认值为1MB，可以通过lctl工具进行动态调整，例如使用`lctl set_param`临时修改或`lctl conf param`永久保存配置。2. 在启用Data-onMDT（DoM）特性时，dom_stripesize 参数决定了DoM文件的第一个组件（即存储在MDT上的部分）的最大大小。当用户通过`lfs setstripe`命令创建DoM文件时，如果指定的组件大小超过MDT上设置的dom_stripesize值，系统会自动将其截断至该限制。3. 当将dom_stripesize设置为0时，可以禁用DoM文件的创建功能，但已有的DoM文件仍可保留。此外，每个MDT可以独立设置不同的dom_stripesize值，以实现更灵活的资源管理。4. 除了直接限制DoM文件的大小外，dom_stripesize还与Lustre的其他参数如qos_threshold_rr和qos_prio_free协同工作，影响文件在多个OST之间的分布策略，进而优化整体性能。5. 在实际应用中，用户可以通过`lfs getstripe`命令查看文件的布局信息，包括其使用的dom_stripesize值，同时利用`lfs find`命令搜索具有特定布局或条带大小的DoM文件或目录，便于管理和监控。6. 需要注意的是，虽然dom_stripesize限制了DoM文件的大小，但Lustre还存在其他限制，如最小条带大小和文件系统级别的限制，这些都会对最终的文件布局产生影响。因此，在配置和使用DoM特性时，需要综合考虑这些因素，以达到最佳的性能和资源利用率。
  - expected output: dom_stripesize参数是MDT服务器上的一个重要参数，用于控制DoM文件的最大条带大小，其默认值为1MB，可通过lctl工具进行更改，包括暂时性设置和永久性设置。在启用Data-onMDT（DoM）特性时，该参数起到关键作用：一方面，它限制了DoM组件的最大大小，防止MDT被大文件填满，若用户指定的DoM组件大小超过该参数设置，将被截断到MDT指定的限制；另一方面，当将dom_stripesize设为0时，可禁用DoM文件创建。此外，DoM组件的最大大小还受到Lustre C/E AZ（LFS）限制，即受Lustre中的最小条带大小所限，其组件最大大小只能为64KB。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['本文档介绍了Lustre文件系统中DoM（Directory Object Manager）相关操作，包括使用`lfs getstripe`命令查看DoM文件的布局和大小，以及`lfs find`命令搜索具有特定布局或条带大小的DoM文件或目录。还详细说明了如何通过`lctl`工具设置和获取MDT上的`dom_stripesize`参数，该参数控制DoM文件的最大条带大小。此外，文档提到可以通过将`dom_stripesize`设为0来禁用DoM文件创建。最后简要提及了MDT的Lazy大小功能（LSOM）。', '该文本介绍了Lustre文件系统中DoM（Directory of Metadata）布局的设置和管理。首先，通过`lfs setstripe`命令可以为目录设置DoM布局，使得在此目录下创建的文件默认继承该布局。使用`lfs getstripe`可查看文件或目录的布局信息，包括组件大小、条带数量、条带大小、模式等。DoM组件的最大大小受多种限制，如Lustre的最小条带大小限制和MDT服务器的参数设置。此外，DoM布局允许将元数据分散到多个OST上，提高性能。', '当两个OST的空闲空间差异超过指定阈值时，使用加权分配法，该参数由qos_threshold_rr定义。默认qos_threshold设置为25，可通过命令调整。加权优先级由qos_prio_free参数控制，增加该值会提高对空闲空间的权重。当设置为100时，条带算法仅基于空闲空间。Lustre文件可分条在多个OST上，具体数量取决于MDT类型和功能。DoM功能通过将小文件存储在MDT上提升性能，支持组合布局，使用lfs setstripe命令创建。', ':Imm pattern: mdtImm layout gen: 0Imm Stripe offset: 2Imm_ objects:lcome_id: 2lcme flags: 0lcome extent.e start: 1048576lome_extent.e end: EOFImm stripe count: 1Imm stripe size: 1048576Imm _ pattern: raid0OImm layout gen: 65535Imm stripe offset: -1我们可以看到该目录中的第一个文件 normfile 具有普通布局，而文件 domfile 继承了目录的默认布局，为 DoM 文件。注意尽管服务器的 DoM 大小限制会被设置成一个较低的值，该目录的默认布局设置仍会被新文件继承。20.2.3.DoM 条带大小限制DoM 组件的最大大小受到几种限制，以预防 MDT 最终被大文件填满。20.2.3.1.

  - input: 某并行应用在一个大型HPC集群上运行，需要频繁读写大量小文件。管理员观察到访问延迟偏高，怀疑与文件系统配置有关。请问在这种场景下，可以利用Lustre的哪些机制优化小文件访问性能？具体应该怎么配置？需要注意哪些风险？
  - actual output: 针对该场景，Lustre文件系统可以通过条带化、合理配置分片数、优化IO设置等机制来优化小文件访问性能。具体配置方法包括使用lfs setstripe命令调整分片数量和大小，并根据工作负载分类存储大文件和小文件。同时需要注意分片数过多可能带来的元数据开销增加以及数据丢失风险等问题。1. 利用条带化机制提升性能：Lustre通过将文件分散存储在多个OST上，提高I/O性能。对于小文件，适当增加分片数可以提升聚合带宽和IOPS，但需避免分片数过多导致的元数据开销增加。2. 合理配置分片数和大小：根据工作负载调整分片数，推荐将大文件和小文件分类存储，并在目录级别设置不同的分片策略。使用lfs setstripe命令设置分片数量，例如设置为64或全部可用OST。3. 优化IO设置：禁用锁定以减少争用，使用O_DIRECT模式避免页面IO提交，确保应用程序写入连续数据。此外，增加OST磁盘或使用SSD可提高IOPS速率，创建更大的OST而非多个小OST也能减少开销。4. 注意风险：分片数过多会增加元数据操作的开销，如ls命令需要遍历所有分片所在服务器。同时，文件分布在多个OST上时，若某个OST故障可能导致部分数据丢失，而单一分片则可能造成整个文件丢失。因此需权衡分片数与数据可靠性。5. 其他优化措施：选择合适的条带大小（如1MB-4MB），避免过小的条带大小导致磁盘IO效率低下。对于高速网络环境，条带大小应在1MB到4MB之间，过大可能增加锁竞争。同时，确保条带大小与应用的写入模式匹配，避免跨对象写入带来的性能损失。
  - expected output: 在大型HPC集群上运行频繁读写大量小文件的并行应用时，可利用Lustre的条带化机制和DoM特性优化小文件访问性能。具体来说，一方面可通过条带化将数据分散存储在多个OST上，提升聚合带宽和IOPS，配置时使用lfs setstripe命令设置合适的条带数量，如根据工作负载将条带数设为64或全部（-1），并将大文件与小文件分类存储在不同目录以在目录级别设置不同分片策略，同时条带大小选择1MB-4MB，避免小于512KB以保证磁盘IO效率；另一方面利用DoM特性将小文件直接放在MDT上，减少OST随机小IO影响，配置时通过lctl工具设置dom_stripesize参数控制DoM文件最大条带大小，默认1MB，还可设为0禁用DoM文件创建。需要注意的是，条带数配置过高会增加元数据开销，如ls时遍历更多服务器，且条带化会增加锁定和网络操作开销，DoM组件大小还受Lustre最小条带大小限制为64KB。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question focuses on configuring network request scheduling policies for Lustre filesystems, which is a specific technical task related to storage systems. The assistant provided an explanation about the general concept of NRS (Node Record Size) and its impact on performance, but did not address how to configure it or other relevant parameters like stripe size configuration. It also mentioned other unrelated topics such as CPU governor settings and I/O schedulers which are irrelevant to Lustre's network-related tuning., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score is 0.5, indicating moderate alignment between the assistant's response and the user query regarding the use of LLMs in healthcare decision-making. The contradictions are present because the claim mentions 'TBF' but the retrieval context refers to 'TBF'. This discrepancy indicates a potential error or miscommunication., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about configuring the scheduling policy for Lustre OST (Object Storage Target) services in Lustre file system to optimize performance. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict and one with negative. However, the question specifically asks about 'OST service' which refers to Object Storage Targets in the context of CephFS or distributed storage systems. In the first node (node 1), it discusses configuring NRS parameters for general Lustre configuration but does not mention OST services explicitly. The second node (node 2) directly addresses the scheduling policy and its impact on performance, which is relevant to the user's query about optimizing read/write operations in distributed storage systems like CephFS. Therefore, I will rank node 1 as less relevant because it doesn't specifically address OST service configuration for Lustre, while node 2 provides more direct information on tuning parameters including scheduling policies., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4583333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide any information about Lustre file system configuration or network scheduling policies, and instead focuses on unrelated topics like Albert Einstein's biography., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何通过参数配置 Lustre 文件系统的 OST 服务网络请求调度策略（NRS）以优化批量读写性能？请结合策略类型及参数含义说明。
  - actual output: 通过参数配置 Lustre 文件系统的 OST 服务网络请求调度策略（NRS）以优化批量读写性能，主要涉及以下几种策略类型及对应的参数设置：1. TBF（令牌桶过滤器）策略：TBF 策略用于限制 RPC 请求的速率，确保服务质量。可以通过 lctl 命令配置 TBF 规则，例如添加实时特性以确保高优先级请求的带宽分配。命令格式为 lctl set param x.x.x.nrs tbf rule="start rule name arguments... realtime=1"。例如，设置 JobID 为 dd.0 的 RPC 以 100 req/sec 的速率进行实时处理。TBF 策略支持基于 NID、JobID、OPCode、UID/GID 等分类，并通过规则列表动态调整速率限制。2. 延迟策略：延迟策略通过模拟高负载来测试系统对时间敏感问题的处理能力，允许设置请求延迟的最小和最大时间范围。参数 {service}.nrs delay min 控制请求被延迟的最短时间，而 {service}.nrs delay max 控制最长延迟时间。例如，设置 ost.io 服务的最小延迟时间为 10 秒，最大延迟时间为 300 秒。3. ORR（基于对象的循环）策略：ORR 策略用于设置支持的 RPC 类型，如 reads、writes 或 reads_and_writes。通过 lctl set param 命令设置 ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs orr supported 参数，可以指定支持的 RPC 类型。例如，设置支持 reads_and_writes 类型。4. TRR（基于目标的循环）策略：TRR 策略基于目标 OST 索引进行批量循环调度，其参数与 ORR 类似。通过设置 ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs trr quantum 参数，可以调整每个批次的大小。TRR 策略与 ORR 策略类似，但使用目标 OST 索引而不是后端 fs 对象的 OST FID 来确定调度顺序。5. 实时特性：在 TBF 策略中，可以通过设置 realtime=1 参数为特定类别的请求提供实时处理，确保其带宽分配。当请求错过最后期限时，该类保持最后期限不变，剩余的时间将被补偿到下一轮，从而确保下一个空闲 IO 线程始终选择此类来服务。6. 配置文件布局：通过 lfs setstripe 命令配置文件布局，设置条带数量、大小和起始 OST，以实现负载均衡和空间利用。例如，设置 stripe_size 为 1MB，stripe_count 为 4，start_ost 为 -1（默认值）。7. 条带化设置：将文件分割到尽可能多的 OST 上，以达到所需的峰值聚合带宽。对于大文件或高并发访问场景，最多支持 2000 个 OST。条带大小应设置为 write 大小的整数倍，避免锁定争用。8. 过度分条（overstriping）：从 Lustre 2.13 开始，允许每个 OST 有多个条带，这对于线程数超过 OST 数的情况特别有帮助，使得条带数与线程数匹配。9. 参数调整：根据实际需求调整 NRS 相关参数，如 {service}.nrs delay min 和 {service}.nrs delay max，以控制请求的延迟范围。同时，通过 lctl get param 命令查看当前参数设置，确保配置符合预期。10. 策略启用：通过 lctl set param 命令启用 TBF 策略，例如设置 ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs policies="tbf" 以启用基于所有分类方式的 TBF 策略。此外，还可以根据需要选择特定的分类方式，如基于 NID、JobID、OPCode、UID/GID 等。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过配置OST服务的网络请求调度策略（NRS）来优化批量读写性能，主要策略及参数配置如下：1. 基于对象的循环（ORR）策略，通过`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs orr_supported`参数设置支持的RPC类型为`reads`、`writes`或`reads_and_writes`，还可利用`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs orr_quantum`参数调整调度量子以控制每轮处理的请求量；2. 基于目标的循环（TRR）策略，其参数如`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs trr_quantum`、`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs trr_offset_type`、`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs trr_supported`与ORR策略类似，主要针对brw RPC按目标OST索引执行批量循环调度；3. 令牌桶过滤（TBF）策略，启用时通过`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs policies="tbf [nid|jobid|opcode|uid|gid]"`指定分类方式，然后用`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs tbf rule`参数定义规则，例如`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs tbf rule="start rule_name nid={nidlist} rate=rate"`基于NID设置速率，且可添加`realtime=1`实现实时特性保障高优先级请求带宽，规则按顺序匹配，支持运行时动态调整；4. 延迟策略，虽主要用于模拟负载测试，但通过`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_min`和`ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_max`设置请求延迟范围，可间接优化时间敏感型请求的调度。实际配置时，需根据业务场景组合使用这些策略，比如对批量读写作业用ORR/TRR实现负载均衡，用TBF限制高并发请求速率，同时结合实时参数确保关键任务带宽，以达到优化批量读写性能的目的。

For test case:

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，如何通过参数配置 OST 服务的 Delay 策略延迟处理请求的时间范围？请说明相关参数的含义及配置方法。
  - actual output: 在Lustre文件系统中，通过参数配置OST服务的Delay策略延迟处理请求的时间范围主要涉及三个关键参数：{service}.nrs_delay_min、{service}.nrs_delay_max和{service}.nrs_delay_pct。这些参数允许用户定义请求被延迟的最小时间、最大时间和被延迟请求的百分比，从而模拟高负载环境以测试系统的稳定性。1. {service}.nrs_delay_min用于控制请求被此策略延迟的最短时间量，单位为秒，默认值是5秒。可以通过lctl get param命令查看当前设置，例如运行“lctl get param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_min”来获取最小延迟时间。要设置新的最小延迟时间，可以使用“lctl set param {service}.nrs_delay_min=0-65535”命令，其中0-65535表示可设置的数值范围。对于支持高优先级RPC的服务，还可以分别设置常规和高优先级RPC的最小延迟时间，格式为“{service}.nrs_delay_min=reg_delay_min|hp_delay_min:0-65535”。2. {service}.nrs_delay_max用于控制请求被此策略延迟的最长时间量，单位为秒，默认值是300秒。同样，可以通过“lctl get param {service}.nrs_delay_max”命令查看当前设置，例如“lctl get param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_max”。设置最大延迟时间的方法是使用“lctl set param {service}.nrs_delay_max=0-65535”命令，其中0-65535为可设置的数值范围。对于支持高优先级RPC的服务，也可以分别设置常规和高优先级RPC的最大延迟时间，格式为“{service}.nrs_delay_max=reg_delay_max|hp_delay_max:0-65535”。3. {service}.nrs_delay_pct用于控制会被此延迟策略推迟的请求的百分比，默认值是100%。可以通过“lctl get param {service}.nrs_delay_pct”命令查看当前设置，例如“lctl get param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_pct”。设置延迟请求的百分比时，使用“lctl set param {service}.nrs_delay_pct=0-100”命令，其中0-100表示可设置的百分比范围。对于支持高优先级RPC的服务，还可以分别设置常规和高优先级RPC的请求延迟百分比，格式为“{service}.nrs_delay_pct=reg_delay_pct|hp_delay_pct:0-100”。需要注意的是，在任何情况下，最小延迟时间不能超过最大延迟时间，且最大延迟时间不能小于最小延迟时间。通过合理配置这些参数，可以有效地测试Lustre文件系统在高负载情况下的性能和稳定性。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过配置NRS延迟策略的相关参数来控制OST服务处理请求的延迟时间范围，具体如下：1. {service}.nrs_delay_min，用于控制请求被延迟的最短时间，默认5秒，可通过lctl get_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_min读取，使用lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_min=10可将常规请求最小延迟设为10秒，若服务支持高优先级RPC，还能通过lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_min=hp_delay_min:3将高优先级请求最小延迟设为3秒，且最小延迟不能超过最大延迟；2. {service}.nrs_delay_max，用于控制请求被延迟的最长时间，默认300秒，通过lctl get_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_max读取，例如lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_max=60可将常规请求最大延迟设为60秒，同样能为高优先级RPC单独设置，如lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_max=hp_delay_max:30设为30秒，且最长延迟不能小于最短延迟；3. {service}.nrs_delay_pct，用于控制被延迟请求的百分比，默认100%，即所有请求都延迟，通过lctl get_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_pct读取，若设置为50，如lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_delay_pct=50，则表示50%的请求会被延迟，未被延迟的请求按FIFO等回退策略处理，也可对高优先级RPC单独设置延迟百分比。通过合理配置这些参数，可在Lustre中精准控制OST服务请求的延迟时间范围，以满足测试或性能优化需求。

For test case:

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，如何通过参数配置客户端的预读机制以优化顺序读取性能？请结合最大预读量、单文件预读限制及文件大小阈值说明。
  - actual output: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，通过调整客户端的预读机制参数可以有效优化顺序读取性能，主要涉及最大预读量、单文件预读限制以及文件大小阈值等参数。1. 最大预读量方面，`max_read_ahead_mb` 参数用于控制客户端整体的预读数据量，该值是针对所有文件的全局限制，不能超过客户端 RAM 的 12%。此参数决定了在顺序读取时，客户端能够预读的最大数据量，从而减少网络 I/O 次数，提高读取效率。如果需要禁用预读功能，可将 `max_read_ahead_mb` 设置为 0。2. 单文件预读限制方面，`max_read_ahead_per_file_mb` 参数用于控制每个文件的预读数据量，该值不能超过 `max_read_ahead_mb` 的设置。当文件被顺序读取时，该参数限制了客户端对单个文件的预读上限，避免因单个文件占用过多内存而影响其他文件的读取性能。3. 文件大小阈值方面，`max_read_ahead_whole_mb` 参数用于控制预读整个文件的最大文件大小，该参数避免了在读取较小文件时因多次 RPC 调用导致的性能下降。默认情况下，该值为 2 MiB 或一个 RPC 的大小（如 `max_pages_per_rpc` 所指定）。对于较大的文件，该参数允许客户端根据实际需求进行更高效的预读，提升读取速度。综上所述，通过合理配置这些参数，可以在不同场景下优化 Lustre 文件系统的顺序读取性能，确保资源的高效利用。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过配置客户端预读机制相关参数优化顺序读取性能，具体如下：1. 最大预读量，通过llite.fsname-instance.max_read_ahead_mb参数控制全局最大预读数据量，其值不能超过客户端RAM的1/2，例如设置为llite.*.max_read_ahead_mb=128时，客户端预读总量不超过128MB，若设为0则禁用预读；2. 单文件预读限制，利用llite.fsname-instance.max_read_ahead_per_file_mb参数设置单个文件的最大预读量，且该值不能大于最大预读量，如llite.*.max_read_ahead_per_file_mb=64表示单文件预读不超过64MB；3. 文件大小阈值，借助llite.fsname-instance.max_read_ahead_whole_mb参数控制预读整个文件的最大大小，默认值为2MB或一个RPC的大小（由max_pages_per_rpc决定），例如llite.*.max_read_ahead_whole_mb=4时，大于4MB的文件不会被整体预读。通过合理设置这些参数，可在顺序读取场景中提升数据预读效率，减少磁盘IO等待，从而优化性能。

  - input: 如何通过参数配置 Lustre 的 HSM（分层存储管理）协调器线程行为及请求处理策略？请结合线程启停、请求清理和重试等机制说明。
  - actual output: Lustre 的 HSM 协调器线程行为及请求处理策略可以通过多种参数进行配置，这些参数涉及线程的启停、请求的清理和重试机制等。首先，协调器线程的启停可以通过 hsm_control 参数控制，该参数支持 enabled（启用协调器线程）、disabled（暂停协调器活动）和 shutdown（关闭协调器线程）三种状态，其中 enabled 状态下协调器会分发请求，而 disabled 状态下不会处理新请求，但已注册的请求会在协调器重新启动后继续处理，shutdown 状态则完全关闭协调器线程，无法提交新请求。其次，请求清理可以通过 purge 值实现，该值可以清除所有记录的请求，但不会改变协调器的状态。此外，请求的超时时间可以通过设置 active request timeout 参数来调整，默认值为 3600 秒，该参数确保 copytool 在规定时间内完成请求，避免系统阻塞。对于请求的重试机制，可以通过 policy 参数进行配置，例如设置 NRA（不进行重试）或 NBR（不阻塞 IO 来等待恢复），从而控制失败请求的处理方式。最后，grace delay 参数用于设置从整个请求列表中清除请求（成功或失败）的延迟时间，单位为秒，通过调整该参数可以控制请求的清理时机。1. 通过 hsm_control 参数控制协调器线程的启停，包括 enabled、disabled 和 shutdown 状态。2. 使用 purge 值清除所有记录的请求，但不改变协调器状态。3. 设置 active request timeout 参数调整请求的超时时间，防止系统阻塞。4. 通过 policy 参数配置请求的重试机制，如 NRA 和 NBR。5. 调整 grace delay 参数控制请求的清理时机。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过配置相关参数来管理HSM协调器线程行为及请求处理策略，具体如下：1. 线程启停控制，通过hsm_control参数实现，lctl set param mdt.SFSNAME-MDT000.hsm_control=enabled启用协调器线程以分发请求，disabled暂停活动但保留新请求，shutdown关闭线程且无法提交请求，purge清除所有请求但不改变状态；2. 请求处理策略，max_requests参数限制协调器处理的最大请求数，如lctl set param mdt.SFSNAME-MDT000.hsm.max_requests=10，policy参数可调整行为，+NRA表示恢复失败不重调度，+NBR表示触发恢复但不阻塞客户端IO；3. 请求清理机制，grace_delay参数设置请求成功或失败后从列表中清除的延迟时间，单位秒，如lctl set param mdt.SFSNAME-MDT000.hsm.grace_delay=10；4. 超时与重试，active_request_timeout参数设置请求处理超时时间，默认3600秒，可通过lctl set param -n mdt.lustre-MDT0000.hsm.active_request_timeout调整，自动恢复机制会在访问已释放文件时触发，阻塞IO直至恢复完成。通过这些参数配置，可有效管理HSM协调器的线程行为和请求处理策略，确保分层存储管理的高效运行。

  - actual output: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，通过参数配置实现对客户端 Root 用户权限的细粒度控制主要依赖于 Root Squash 机制及例外客户端设置。Root Squash 是一种安全功能，用于限制超级用户访问 Lustre 文件系统的权限，它将 root 用户的 UID 和 GID 映射为指定的值，防止未授权客户端访问 root 文件。1. 配置 Root Squash 参数：Root Squash 由两种配置参数进行管理，即 root_squash 和 nosquash_nids。root_squash 参数用于指定 root 用户访问 Lustre 文件系统使用的 UID 和 GID，例如设置为 500:501。该参数可通过 mkfs.lustre、tunefs.lustre 或 lctl 命令进行配置。2. 设置例外客户端：nosquash_nids 参数用于指定不适用 Root Squash 的一组客户端，使用 LNet NID 范围的语法，如 —nosquash nids=172.16.245.[0-255/2]@tcp，表示子网 172.16.245.0 IP 地址最后一部分为偶数的 TCP 客户端不适用 Root Squash。3. 注意事项和调试：mkfs.lustre 和 tunefs.lustre 不进行参数语法检查，错误的 root squash 参数会在挂载时被忽略，系统将使用默认值。root_squash 参数应由 <dqecnum>:<dqecnum> 指定，而 nosquash_nids 参数应遵循 LNet NID 范围的语法。此外，lctl conf param 命令必须在活动 MGS 上运行，并且每次只能更改一个参数。通过这些配置，可以实现对客户端 Root 用户权限的细粒度控制，确保系统的安全性。
  - expected output: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，可通过 Root Squash 机制及例外客户端设置实现对客户端 Root 用户权限的细粒度控制。具体来说，利用root_squash参数指定 Root 用户访问文件系统时映射的 UID 和 GID，如设置为mdt.root_squash="500:501"，这样 Root 用户的权限会被映射为普通用户权限，限制其对系统文件的访问；同时，通过nosquash_nids参数设置不应用 Root Squash 的客户端 NID 范围，例如mdt.nosquash_nids="192.168.1.[10,11]@tcp"，这些指定客户端的 Root 用户将保留原始权限。配置可通过mkfs.lustre或lctl conf param命令进行，前者在创建 MDT 时设置，后者可动态修改，且lctl set_param -P可永久保存配置。需注意参数语法要严格符合 LNet NID 范围规则，错误语法会导致设置被忽略而使用默认值。

层进行设置。为了减少配额请求，最初配额空间以非常大的块分配给 QSDs。一个目标可以容纳多少未使用的配额空间由 qunit 大小控制。当给定 ID 的配额空间在 QMT 上快要耗尽时，qunit 大小将会减少，QSD 将通过"glimpse callback" 获悉新的 qunit 大小值。随后，从设备需要释放比新的 qunit 值更大的配额空间。qunit 大小不会无限缩小，对于块来说，其最小值为 JIMB，对于 inodes 来说，其最小值为 1024。这意味痢达到此最小值时配额空间重新平衡过程将停止。因此，即使许多从设备还有 1MB 块或 1024 个 inode 的剩余配额空间，仍会返回配额超标的消息。如果我们再次查看setdquota示例，运行以下1fs duota命今:1 # 1fs quota -u bob -v

为进程和用户定义了受限域和非受限域。每个进程、用户、文件都被分配了一个安全环境，规则定义了进程和用户对文件允许执行的操作。SELinux 的另一个目的是保护数据的敏感性，这要归功于多级安全 (MLS) 功能MLS 是在 SELinux 的基础上，通过定义域之外的安全级别概念发挥作用。每个进程、用户和文件都被分配了一个安全级别，且该模型规定，进程和用户可以读取与自己相同或更低的安全级别的数据，但只能写入与自己相同或更高的安全级别的数据。从文件系统的角度来看，文件的安全环境必须持久存储。Lustre 利用文件上的security.selLinux扩展属性来存储这些信息。Lustre 在客户问文持SELinux。要在Lustre 上实现 MAC 和MLS，需要做的就是在所有 Lustre 客户端上执行适当的 SELinux策略 〈由 Linux 发行版提供) 。Lustre 服务锅上不需要 SELinux 策略。因为 Lustre 是一个分布式文件系统，所以使用MLS 的特殊性在于，Lustre 确实需要确保", '来禁用。25.4.1 用法lfs quota

  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，客户端的数据校验机制可通过参数配置实现，主要涉及校验算法的设置与管理。Lustre支持多种校验算法，如CRC32C等，可通过相关参数指定使用的校验算法类型。配置时，可在创建文件系统时使用`mkfs.lustre`命令并添加`--param`选项设置校验相关参数，例如`--param="checksum=algorithm_name"`来指定校验算法。当文件系统运行时，可通过`lctl set_param`命令临时设置校验参数，或使用`lctl conf_param`永久设置，如`lctl conf_param fsname.llite.checksum=algorithm_name`。此外，还可通过参数配置校验数据的块大小等相关参数，以优化校验性能。需注意参数的正确语法和格式，确保配置生效。

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，read_cache_enable、writethrough_cache_enable和readcache_max_filesize参数分别有什么作用？如何通过这些参数优化 OSS 的缓存策略？
  - actual output: read_cache_enable、writethrough_cache_enable和readcache_max_filesize参数在Lustre文件系统中分别用于控制缓存行为，以优化OSS的性能。1. read_cache_enable用于启用或禁用读缓存功能，当启用时，OSS在处理相同数据的读取请求时会直接使用内存中的数据，提升性能；若禁用，则数据在读取后会被丢弃。2. writethrough_cache_enable用于控制写入数据是否保留在内存中供后续读取，适用于需要立即访问刚写入数据的场景，如生产者-消费者模型等。3. readcache_max_filesize用于限制缓存中保留的文件最大大小，避免大文件占用缓存资源，从而让更多的小文件能被缓存，提高小文件重复访问的效率。通过合理设置这些参数，可以优化OSS的缓存策略：首先，根据工作负载选择是否启用读缓存和写通缓存，例如在频繁读取小文件的场景下启用读缓存，在需要快速访问刚写入数据的场景下启用写通缓存；其次，设置readcache_max_filesize参数，将缓存限制在合理范围内，确保小文件能够充分利用缓存资源，同时避免大文件占用过多内存；最后，结合具体应用场景调整参数值，例如在OSS的所有OST上设置readcache_max_filesize为32MB，以平衡缓存利用率和性能表现。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，`read_cache_enable`、`writethrough_cache_enable`和`readcache_max_filesize`这三个参数分别在OSS的缓存策略中发挥着重要作用，合理配置它们可以优化OSS的缓存性能。其中，`read_cache_enable`用于控制读缓存是否启用，默认启用时，OSS处理读取请求后会将数据保留在内存中，后续相同数据的读取可直接从缓存获取，提升性能；禁用时，读取数据后会丢弃，后续读取需重新从磁盘获取。`writethrough_cache_enable`用于控制写入数据是否保留在读缓存中，默认启用时，写入数据会保留在内存，便于后续读取；禁用时，写入完成后数据从缓存丢弃，适用于写入后短时间内不读取的场景。`readcache_max_filesize`用于限制缓存中保留文件的最大大小，大于该值的文件不被缓存，可避免大文件占用缓存空间，让小文件更易保留在缓存中。优化OSS缓存策略时，若多个客户端重复访问小文件，可启用`read_cache_enable`和`writethrough_cache_enable`，并将`readcache_max_filesize`设为如32M等合适值，以保留小文件缓存；若文件写入后短时间内不读取，可禁用`writethrough_cache_enable`；若要禁用读缓存，可将`read_cache_enable`设为0。通过`lctl set param`命令可对这些参数进行设置，如`lctl set param obdfilter.*.read_cache_enable=1`启用读缓存，`lctl set param obdfilter.*.writethrough_cache_enable=0`禁用写通缓存，`lctl set param obdfilter.*.readcache_max_filesize=32M`设置最大缓存文件大小为32M，从而根据实际工作负载优化OSS的缓存策略，提升系统性能。

。对这种MO请求，将强制执行日志刷新。启用异步日志提交功能后，客户端节点会将数据保留在页面缓存中 (增加页面引用) 。 Lustre客户端将监视从O5SS发送到客户端的消息中的最后提交的交易号 (TransactionNumber, transno) 。当客户端看到OSs报告的最后一个 是交的 transno = BIDS 等于批量写入的 transno AY, 它会在相应的页面上释放5引用。 为了避免批量写入后，持有页面引用对时间过长，客户端在收到批量写入的回复后将发起7秒的ping请求 (0SS文件系统提交默认时间间隔为5秒) ，以便OSSs报告最后提交的transno 。如果O55在日志提交发生之前谢演， 则中间数据就会丢失。然而，包含了异步日志提交功能的0Ss恢复功能会要求客户端重发与请求，然后通过恢复文件系统的状态来恢复丢失的磁盘更新。默认情况下， sync journal

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not address the user query about the purpose and function of 'reserved_mb' parameters in Lustre filesystem configuration. It only mentions that these parameters are used to reserve space for system use, but doesn't explain how they affect file allocation or storage management specifically within Lustre's architecture., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about the Lustre file system and its use of reserved space parameters. The response correctly mentions that Lustre uses Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for storage management, but does not explicitly mention LSoM or how it manages reserved space differently from traditional filesystems. However, the key point in the contradiction is that the user mentioned 'LSoM' while the correct term should be 'Logical Volumes'. The response did not address this discrepancy and instead provided information about LVM (Logical Volume Manager) which is a different concept altogether. This might confuse users looking for specific Lustre configuration details on reserved space management, as they may think that Lustre uses LVM or LVM tools for storage management when it actually has its own system called 'Lustre Logical Volumes' or similar concepts but not exactly the same as LVM (Logical Volume Manager). The response should have clarified this point to avoid confusion and provide accurate information about Lustre's reserved space mechanism., error: None)

  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Albert Einstein or his birthplace, nationality, or related topics., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，reserved_mb_low和reserved_mb_high参数的作用是什么？如何通过这两个参数优化 OST 的空间分配策略？
  - actual output: 综述：在 Lustre 文件系统中，reserved_mb_low 和 reserved_mb_high 参数用于控制 OST 的空间分配策略，通过调整这两个参数可以优化文件系统的性能和空间利用率。1. reserved_mb_low 参数的作用是设置 OST 可用空间的最低保留阈值，当 OST 的可用空间低于该阈值时，MDT 会停止在该 OST 上分配对象，以防止空间不足导致的问题。2. reserved_mb_high 参数的作用是设置 OST 可用空间的最高保留阈值，当 OST 的可用空间高于该阈值时，MDT 会重新开始在该 OST 上分配对象，从而充分利用 OST 的存储空间。3. 通过合理配置 reserved_mb_low 和 reserved_mb_high 参数，可以平衡 OST 的负载，避免某些 OST 过度使用而其他 OST 空闲的情况，提高整体的存储效率和性能。具体设置方法包括将所有 MDT 的 osp.{{ fsname }}-*.reserved_mb_low 和 osp.{{ filesystem.fsname }}-*.reserved_mb_high 设置为相应的 MiB 值，以适应实际的存储需求和工作负载。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，reserved_mb_low和reserved_mb_high参数用于控制OST的空间分配策略，确保系统在空间使用和分配上的平衡与稳定。其中，reserved_mb_low设置OST可用空间的低阈值，默认占OST总容量的0.1%，当OST可用空间低于该阈值且空闲inode少于32个时，MDT会停止在该OST上分配新对象；reserved_mb_high设置OST可用空间的高阈值，默认占OST总容量的0.2%，当OST可用空间高于该阈值且空闲inode超过64个时，MDT重新开始在该OST上分配对象。通过这两个参数优化OST空间分配策略时，可先根据OST总容量计算出合理的阈值范围，例如若OST总容量为1TB，reserved_mb_low可设为1GB（1TB的0.1%），reserved_mb_high设为2GB（1TB的0.2%），然后使用lctl命令分别对所有MDT的osp.{{fsname}}-*.reserved_mb_low和osp.{{fsname}}-*.reserved_mb_high进行设置。这样能使系统在OST空间不足时暂停分配，避免过度使用导致空间耗尽，又能在空间充足时恢复分配，保证存储资源的有效利用，同时结合循环分配和加权分配算法，进一步优化文件条带在OST间的分配，提升系统整体性能。

For test case:

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，如何通过参数配置实现对客户端连接的故障恢复时限控制？请结合软时限（recovery_time_soft）和硬时限（recovery_time_hard）参数说明作用。
  - actual output: Lustre 文件系统中通过 `recovery_time_soft` 和 `recovery_time_hard` 参数控制客户端连接的故障恢复时限，这两个参数分别对应软时限和硬时限，用于管理客户端在服务器故障后重新连接和恢复操作的时间窗口，具体工作原理如下：1. `recovery_time_soft` 参数定义了客户端在服务器故障后尝试恢复连接的软性时间限制，该参数决定了客户端在服务器进入恢复模式后，允许其等待服务器完成恢复操作的最长时间。在此时间内，客户端会持续尝试与服务器建立连接，并重放未完成的请求。如果在软时限内服务器完成了恢复并接受了客户端的连接，客户端可以继续执行后续操作；若超时，则客户端可能进入断开状态并触发重试机制。2. `recovery_time_hard` 参数则设定了客户端在服务器故障后恢复操作的硬性时间限制，即客户端在超过此时间后将不再尝试恢复连接，而是直接终止当前操作并返回错误。该参数作为最终的保障措施，防止客户端无限期地等待服务器恢复，从而避免资源浪费和系统阻塞。当服务器在硬时限内未能完成恢复时，客户端将放弃恢复尝试，确保系统能够快速响应其他请求。综上所述，`recovery_time_soft` 用于控制客户端在合理时间内的恢复尝试，而 `recovery_time_hard` 则作为最后的兜底机制，确保系统在极端情况下仍能保持稳定性和可用性。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过`recovery_time_soft`和`recovery_time_hard`这两个参数实现对客户端连接的故障恢复时限控制，它们在故障恢复过程中分别发挥着不同的作用。其中，`recovery_time_soft`为软时限，默认情况下，当客户端连接出现故障时，系统会先尝试在软时限内进行恢复，它允许系统在较短时间内进行自动恢复尝试，给一些临时的网络问题或短暂故障提供恢复机会，若在软时限内恢复成功，客户端连接可快速恢复正常。`recovery_time_hard`为硬时限，若超过软时限后恢复仍未成功，系统会继续尝试恢复直到硬时限到期，硬时限是故障恢复的最终时间限制，一旦达到硬时限，系统会认为该客户端连接无法恢复，进而采取相应的处理措施，如断开连接或标记为故障状态。通过配置这两个参数，可根据实际需求调整客户端连接的故障恢复时限。例如，在网络环境不稳定但希望尽量自动恢复的场景中，可适当延长`recovery_time_soft`和`recovery_time_hard`的值，给系统更多的恢复时间；而在对连接恢复时效性要求较高的场景中，则可缩短这两个时限。具体配置时，可使用`lctl`命令来设置这两个参数，如`lctl set param mdt.{{service name}}.recovery_time_soft={{seconds}}`和`lctl set param mdt.{{service name}}.recovery_time_hard={{seconds}}`，其中`{{seconds}}`为具体的时间值，单位为秒，通过合理设置这两个参数，可有效控制客户端连接的故障恢复时限，提高系统的稳定性和可靠性。

，而其中一个或多个客户端没有及时地重新连接，那么这些客户端可能因为它们的事务依赖于被驱逐的客户端的事务，因而跟着被驱逐。而驱逐这些客户端又会导致更多的客户端被驱逐，从而导致客户端接二连三地被级联驱逐。COS通过消除客户端之间的事务依赖来解决级联驱逐的问题。如果另一个客户端的事务依赖于此客户端的某事务，COS会确保将该事务提交到磁盘。由于客户端不会依赖于其他客户端的未提交事务，因此客户端可以独立地重放其Ta

For test case:

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，如何通过lock_reclaim_threshold_mb和lock_limit_mb参数配置限制客户端 LDLM 锁的内存占用？
  - actual output: Lustre 文件系统中，`lock_reclaim_threshold_mb` 和 `lock_limit_mb` 参数用于控制客户端 LDLM 锁的内存占用，通过合理配置这些参数可以优化系统性能并避免内存资源过度消耗。1. `lock_reclaim_threshold_mb` 参数用于设置客户端在尝试回收 LDLM 锁之前允许的最大锁内存占用阈值，当客户端持有的锁内存超过此阈值时，系统会尝试回收部分锁以释放内存。2. `lock_limit_mb` 参数用于限制客户端可以使用的最大 LDLM 锁内存总量，超过该值后，系统将不再分配新的锁，从而防止内存溢出。3. 配置这两个参数通常需要在 Lustre 客户端的配置文件中进行调整，例如在 `/etc/lustre/` 目录下的相关配置文件中添加或修改参数值，或者通过 `lctl` 命令动态调整参数，具体命令格式为 `lctl set_param <parameter_name>=<value>`，其中 `<parameter_name>` 为 `lock_reclaim_threshold_mb` 或 `lock_limit_mb`，`<value>` 为所需的数值（单位为 MB）。此外，配置参数时应根据实际工作负载和系统内存情况合理设定数值，避免因设置过低导致锁分配失败或设置过高造成内存浪费。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过`lock_reclaim_threshold_mb`和`lock_limit_mb`参数来配置限制客户端LDLM锁的内存占用，这两个参数在控制锁内存使用方面发挥着关键作用。其中，`lock_reclaim_threshold_mb`用于设置LDLM锁占用内存的回收阈值，当锁占用的内存达到该阈值时，系统会触发锁回收机制，释放部分不再使用的锁以减少内存占用；`lock_limit_mb`则用于设置LDLM锁占用内存的最大限制，当锁占用内存超过该限制时，系统会拒绝新的锁请求，防止内存过度使用导致系统性能下降或不稳定。在实际配置时，可根据系统内存大小和业务需求来设置这两个参数的值。例如，若系统内存为32GB，可将`lock_reclaim_threshold_mb`设置为20480（20GB），当锁内存占用达到20GB时启动回收机制，将`lock_limit_mb`设置为24576（24GB），确保锁内存占用不超过24GB。通过`lctl`命令可对这两个参数进行设置，如`lctl set param mdt.{{service name}}.lock_reclaim_threshold_mb=20480`和`lctl set param mdt.{{service name}}.lock_limit_mb=24576`，从而实现对客户端LDLM锁内存占用的有效控制，保障系统的稳定运行。

ctitme、mtime、所有者和其他文件属性。OSS上则存储着每个文件使用的块的大小和数量。要获得正确的文件大小，客户端必须访问存储文件的每个 OST，这意味着当一个文件在多个 OST 上分条时，需要使用多个 RPC来获取文件的大小和块。MDT 上的 Lazy 大小 (LSoM) 功能将文件的大小存储在 MDS上，如果应用程序能接受获取的文件大小不精准，则可以避免访问多个 OST 以获取文件大小。Lazy 意味着不能保证存储在 MDS 上的属性的准确性。由于许多 Lustre 安装环境都使用固态硬盘作为 MDT，因此 LSoM 的目标是通过将数据存储在 MDT 上来加快从 Lustre 文件系统获取文件大小所需的时间。我们和希望Lustre 策略引擎初始使用这一功能，以扫描后端 MDT 存储，或根据不同的大小做出诀策，且不依赖于完全准确的文件大小。类似的例子还包括 Lester, Robinhood, Zester 和供应商提供的许多工具。未来将改进为允许通过1fs finq等工具访问 LSoM 数据。21.2. 启动 LSoM当使用策略引擎扫搞 MDT fa SEN, LSoM 始终处于局用状态，不需要做任何操作来启用获取 LSoM 数据的功能。通过1fs getsom命令也可以访问客户端上的LSoM 数据。因为当前在客户端上通过 xattr 接口访问 LSoM 数据，所以只要缓存了索引251\nLustre 文件系统操作手册 译者: 李硕Tid, xattr_cache 就会在客户端上绥存文件大小和块计数。在大多数情况下，这是可行的，因为它改善了对 LSoM 数据的访问频率。但是，这也意味着，如果在首次访问 xattr后文件大小发生了变化，或者在首次创建文件后不久访问 xattr，LSoM 数据可能会过时。如果需要访问过时的最近 LSoM

Lustre 文件系统并没有机制能够缓解硬件存储改隐。当服务融无法访问或终止服务时，将无法访问文件。Lustre 2.11 中引入了 Lustre 文件级元余 (FLR) 功能，任何 Lustre 文件都可将相同的数据存储在多台 OST 上，以提升系统在存储故障或其它故障发生时的稳健性。在存在多个针像的情况下，可选择最合适的镜像来啊应单个请求，这对 IO 可用性有直接影啊。此外，对于许多客户闯同时读取的文件〈如输入版，共孚库或可执行文件)，可以通过创建文件数据的多个镜像来提高单个文件的并行聚合读取性能。第一阶段的FLR 功能通过延迟写入实现〈如"图 21.1 FLR EIR GA" 所示)。在写入镜像文件时，只有一个主镜像或首选镜像在写入过程中直接更新，而其他镜像将被标记为stale。通过使用命令行工具《由用户或管理员直接运行或通过目动监控工具运行)同步各镜像之间同步，该文件可在随后再次写入其它镜像。Object j (primary, preferred)delayed resync图 25: FLR delay writting图', 'IO 大小值更改为 16MB。临时更改bzw_size，请在 OSS 上运行以下命令:1 oss# lctl set param obdfilter.fsname-OST* .brw_size=16要持久地更改brw_size，请运行:1 oss# lctl set param -P obdfilter.fsname-OST* .brw_size=16当客户端连接到 OST 目标时，它将从目标中获取bzrw_size，并从brw_size中获得其最大值和本地设置作为max_pPages_per_rpc的实际了RPC 大小。因此，要启用16MB 的RPC，客户端的max pages per rpc必须设置为 16M (如果 PAGESIZE 为4KB，则为 4096) 。临时更改max_Pages per _rpc请在客户端上运行以下命令:1 client$ 1Lct] set Param osc.fsname-OST* .max pages per Lpc=16M使更改永久生效，运行:1 client$ lctl set Param -P obdfilter.fsname-OST*.osc.max_ pages per rpc=1™!注意OST 的prw_size可以随时更改。但客户端必须重新安厂并重新协商 RPC 最大大小。34.10. 提升 Lustre 小文件 IO 性能应用程序将小文件块从多个客户端写入单个文件可能会导致较送的 IO 性能。提高Lustre 文件系统小文件的 IO 性能，我们可以:。在将 IO 提交到 Lustre 文件系统之前，应用程序先进行 IO 聚合。默认情况下，Lustre 软件将强制执行 POSIX 语义一致性。因此，如果它们都同时写入同一文件会导致客户端节点之间发生 ping-pong 锁定。如果应用程序使用MPI-IO，则实现此功能的一种直接的方法是在 Lustre ADIO 驱动程序中使用MPI-IO CollectiveWrite 功能。418\nayLustre 文件系统操作手册 译mKAs大。 证应用程序对文件执行 4kB 的O_DIRECT大小IO，并禁用输出文件上的锁定。这可以避免部分页面 IO 提交，以及客户端之间的争用。。让应用程序写入连续的数据。。为 OST 添加更多磁盘或']

功能增加了Lustre文件系统恢复的可靠性，因为该功能可以防止被驱逐的客户端连带着引起其他客户端被驱逐。司用COS后，如果一些Lustre客户端在服务器重启或故障后错过了恢复窗口，剩下的客户端不会因此被驱逐。为了说明COs是如何工作的，让我们先看一下没有COSs的恢复方式。在服务重局后，MDS9将局动并进入恢复模式。客户端开始重新连接并重新执行他们未提交的事务。客户端可以独立地重新执行事务，只要这些事务不相互依赖 (一个客户端的事务不依赖另一个客户端的事务) 。MDSs能够通过基于版本的恢复 (Version-basedRecovery) 这一功能来确定一个事务是否依赖于另一个事务。如果客户端事务之间存在着依赖关系 〈例如，创建和删除同一个文件) ，而其中一个或多个客户端没有及时地重新连接，那么这些客户端可能因为它们的事务依赖于被驱逐的客户端的事务，因而跟着被驱逐。而驱逐这些客户端又会导致更多的客户端被驱逐，从而导致客户端接二连三地被级联驱逐。COS通过消除客户端之间的事务依赖来解决级联驱逐的问题。如果另一个客户端的事务依赖于此客户端的某事务，COS会确保将该事务提交到磁盘。由于客户端不会依赖于其他客户端的未提交事务，因此客户端可以独立地重放其Ta

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，如何通过adaptive_timeout_min和adaptive_timeout_max参数配置客户端的自适应超时机制以优化网络延迟敏感型场景？
  - actual output: 在Lustre文件系统中，通过配置adaptive_timeout_min和adaptive_timeout_max参数可以优化客户端的自适应超时机制，以适应网络延迟敏感型场景。1. adaptive_timeout_min用于设置自适应超时机制的最短超时时间，单位为秒，默认值为0。该参数的作用是为客户端提供一个基础的超时值，但并不直接使用该值。如果由于临时的网络中断导致RPC超时，可以通过增加adaptive_timeout_min的值来补偿，从而避免不必要的超时。2. adaptive_timeout_max用于设置自适应超时机制的最长超时时间，单位为秒，默认值为100秒。该参数是对RPC服务时间的上限估计，当服务时间达到adaptive_timeout_max时，RPC请求将超时。如果硬件缓慢导致服务估计时间超过默认值，可以适当增加adaptive_timeout_max的值，以适应更长的处理时间。3. 设置方法包括将Lustre客户端或服务器的at_min和at_max参数设置为所需的秒数，同时将MGS的相应参数也进行设置。例如，将Lustre客户端或服务器的at_min设置为{{seconds}}，将MGS的at_min设置为{{seconds}}；同样地，将Lustre客户端或服务器的at_max设置为{{seconds}}，将MGS的at_max设置为{{seconds}}。这些参数的调整需要根据实际的网络环境和性能需求进行，以确保系统的稳定性和高效性。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过配置`adaptive_timeout_min`和`adaptive_timeout_max`参数来优化网络延迟敏感型场景的自适应超时机制。其中，`adaptive_timeout_min`用于设置自适应超时机制的最短超时时间，单位为秒，默认值为0，客户端以此为基础进行超时处理，增加该值可补偿因临时网络中断导致的RPC超时；`adaptive_timeout_max`用于设置最长超时时间，是对RPC服务时间的上限估计，若服务时间达到该值，RPC请求即超时，将其设为0会禁用自适应超时机制，改用固定超时方法。在网络延迟敏感场景下，例如低延迟网络环境或对响应时间要求高的应用，可将`adaptive_timeout_min`设为5秒，`adaptive_timeout_max`设为30秒，通过`lctl set param client.{{service name}}.adaptive_timeout_min=5`和`lctl set param client.{{service name}}.adaptive_timeout_max=30`完成配置，使系统在网络波动时能快速响应超时情况，避免因超时设置过长导致的延迟累积，同时通过自适应调整适应短暂网络延迟，优化整体网络通信效率。

  - actual output: 通过配置 Lustre 文件系统中的 ost_tbf_nid_rule_start 和 ost_tbf_rule_change_rate 参数，可以实现对 OST 服务的令牌桶过滤（TBF）策略进行设置，从而限制特定客户端的 RPC 请求速率。具体方法如下：1. 使用 lctl set param 命令配置 TBF 规则，例如通过指定 NID 范围来限制特定客户端的 RPC 请求速率。命令格式为：$ lctl set param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs.tbf rule="start [reg|hp] rule name nid={nidlist} rate=rate"，其中 nidlist 的格式与配置 LNET 路由相同，rate 表示该规则的 RPC 速率上限。例如，限制登录节点的 RPC 请求速率为 100，可使用命令：$ lctl set param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs.tbf rule="start loginnode nid={192.168.1.1@tcp} rate=100"。2. 可以通过 ost_tbf_rule_change_rate 参数调整已有的 TBF 规则的速率。命令格式为：$ lctl set param x.x.x.nrs.tbf rule="[reg|hp] change rule name rate=rate"，例如将登录节点的 RPC 请求速率从 100 调整为 200，可使用命令：$ lctl set param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs.tbf rule="change loginnode rate=200"。3. 如果需要停用某个 TBF 规则，可以使用命令：$ lctl set param x.x.x.nrs.tbf rule="[reg|hp] stop rule name"，例如停用登录节点的规则，可使用命令：$ lctl set param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs.tbf rule="stop loginnode"。此外，TBF 规则还支持基于 JobID、UID/GID、Opcode 等条件进行分类，并可通过逻辑运算符“&”（与）和“|”（或）组合多个条件，实现更精细的流量控制。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可通过`ost_tbf_nid_rule_start`和`ost_tbf_rule_change_rate`参数配置OST服务的TBF策略，以限制特定客户端的RPC请求速率。其中，`ost_tbf_nid_rule_start`用于基于客户端NID创建TBF规则，格式为`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_tbf_rule="start 规则名 nid={NID列表} rate=速率值"`，NID列表支持LNet路由格式，如`192.168.1.[2-128]@tcp`，可精准定位特定客户端或客户端组，例如`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_tbf_rule="start compute_nodes nid={192.168.1.10-20@tcp} rate=500"`可限制IP在192.168.1.10到192.168.1.20之间的客户端RPC速率为500req/sec。`ost_tbf_rule_change_rate`用于修改已创建规则的速率，格式为`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_tbf_rule="change 规则名 rate=新速率值"`，例如`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_tbf_rule="change compute_nodes rate=800"`可将上述规则的速率调整为800req/sec。配置时，新规则默认优先级高于旧规则，还可通过`rank=`参数调整规则顺序，且支持结合JobID、Opcode等条件创建复合规则，实现对特定客户端RPC请求速率的精细化限制。

  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 2 because there are no contradictions between the claim and the provided retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about how to mount a Lustre file system with labels and specify the failover mode. The retrieval contexts provided include information on using `--label` or `-L` options for label-based mounting, but do not explicitly mention the 'failover' aspect in the context of specifying the failover mode. However, they are related as both involve labeling filesystems. One context mentions that labels can be used to identify specific file systems and mount them accordingly, which is relevant because it involves using labels (or tags) for identification and mounting based on those labels. The other contexts mention general information about Lustre, but do not directly address the failover mode parameter. Therefore, the retrieved nodes are somewhat related but lack direct confirmation of the 'failover.mode' parameter., error: None)

  - input: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，如何配置多轨（Multi-Rail）网络以实现 InfiniBand 接口的负载均衡？请结合lnetctl工具及ip2nets参数说明操作步骤。
  - actual output: 配置 Lustre 文件系统中 InfiniBand 接口的负载均衡需要通过多轨网络设置，结合 lnetctl 工具和 ip2nets 参数实现具体操作步骤。1. 配置 lustre.conf 文件以指定网络接口和 IP 地址范围，例如为奇偶客户端分别设置不同的 ip2nets 规则，确保 LNet 能根据客户端的 IP 地址自动选择合适的网络接口；2. 使用 lnetctl 工具添加或删除网络接口，例如运行命令 `lnetctl net add --net tcp --if eth0,eth1` 来配置多个网络接口，并通过 `lnetctl net show -v` 查看网络信息，确认接口状态和配置是否正确；3. 在多轨配置中，确保每个节点的网络接口和 IP 地址模式匹配，例如使用 `ip2nets=\"o2ib0 (ib0) 192.168.[0-1].*\"` 来定义 InfiniBand 接口的 IP 地址范围，使 Lustre 能够根据 IP 模式自动识别并绑定正确的网络接口，从而实现负载均衡。此外，需要注意 ip2nets 中规则的顺序，优先匹配的网络将被首先使用，避免因规则顺序不当导致的网络选择错误。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，配置多轨网络实现InfiniBand接口负载均衡需借助lnetctl工具及ip2nets参数，具体操作如下：首先利用lnetctl工具添加多个InfiniBand网络接口，如`lnetctl net add --net o2ib --if ib0 ib1`，以在本地节点配置多个网络接口；接着通过ip2nets参数定义IP地址与网络的映射规则，例如`options lnet ip2nets="o2ib0 (ib0) 192.168.0.[0-252/2] #偶数服务器；o2ib1 (ib1) 192.168.0.[1-253/2] #奇数服务器"`，使系统能根据IP地址自动选择对应网络接口；然后在lustre.conf文件中整合配置，如`options lnet networks="o2ib0 (ib0),o2ib1 (ib1)"`，指定使用的InfiniBand网络；最后通过`modprobe lnet`加载模块并验证配置，使用`lnetctl net show -v`查看网络状态确保多轨配置生效。如此配置后，Lustre会基于IP2nets规则和lnetctl配置实现InfiniBand接口间的流量分配，当客户端与服务器通信时，系统依据IP地址匹配规则选择对应InfiniBand网络接口传输数据，从而实现负载均衡。

  - actual output: 使用yhalloc获取资源后，通过yhacct实时查询该作业的记账数据，验证资源分配是否符合预期的方法如下：1. 使用yhalloc命令获取资源并执行指定的命令，确保在成功分配资源后运行用户指定的程序，例如通过设置相关选项如--nodes、--cpus-per-task等来控制资源分配；2. 在yhalloc分配资源并执行命令期间，可以使用yhacct命令实时查询作业的记账数据，通过选项如--brief或自定义字段显示作业状态、CPU时间、内存使用等信息，以确认资源是否按预期分配；3. 通过yhacct的过滤选项如--user、--cluster或--jobid等，可以精确查找特定作业的记账数据，结合作业的启动时间、结束状态、退出代码等字段判断资源使用情况是否符合预期，同时注意部分系统可能因getrusage()信息不全导致数据为0的情况。
  - expected output: 使用yhalloc获取资源后，可通过yhacct实时查询作业记账数据以验证资源分配是否符合预期。首先用yhalloc申请资源并执行作业，例如`yhalloc -N 2 -c 4 mycommand`获取2个节点、每节点4核资源并运行命令。作业运行中或结束后，用yhacct查看记账数据，默认会显示作业基本信息，若要查看详细资源分配情况，可使用`yhacct --jobs=JOBID`指定作业ID，或用`--format=field_list`自定义字段，如`yhacct --format="jobid,alloccpus,nnodes,maxrss,avecpu"`查看分配的CPU数、节点数、最大内存使用和平均CPU时间等关键指标。若需原始数据用于调试，可加`--dump`选项。通过对比yhalloc申请的资源参数与yhacct返回的记账数据，如申请的节点数、CPU数与`AllocCPUS`、`NNodes`字段是否一致，内存使用是否在预期范围内，来验证资源分配是否符合预期。

For test case:

  - input: 如何使用yhalloc申请资源运行一个并行作业，并通过yhattach附接到作业步以获取实时 I/O 数据？
  - actual output: yhalloc 是用于请求资源并运行作业的命令，支持多种选项如指定用户、分区、时间限制等，而 yhattach 用于附接到正在运行的作业步以获取 I/O 信息，支持过滤和标签功能。使用 yhalloc 申请资源运行并行作业并使用 yhattach 获取实时 I/O 数据的步骤如下：1. 使用 yhalloc 命令申请资源并启动作业，例如通过指定节点数（-N）、任务数（-n）等参数，确保作业在分配的资源上运行，yhalloc 会等待资源可用并执行用户指定的命令，直到命令结束或收到特定信号如 SIGHUP；2. 在作业运行期间，使用 yhattach 命令附接到作业步以获取实时 I/O 数据，可以通过指定作业 ID 和步骤 ID（jobid.stepid），例如 yhattach 65537.1，同时可以使用过滤选项如 --output-filter=task_number 来仅关注特定任务的输出，或者使用 -l 参数在输出前添加任务号以便识别；3. yhattach 还支持其他选项如 --verbose 提高输出详细程度或 --quiet 减少一般信息的显示，从而更灵活地监控作业的 I/O 活动，确保能够实时获取所需的数据。
  - expected output: 使用yhalloc申请资源运行并行作业并通过yhattach获取实时I/O数据，需按以下步骤操作。首先用yhalloc申请资源，例如`yhalloc -N 2 -c 4 --job-name=parallel_job`申请2个节点、每节点4核资源并命名作业，申请后yhalloc会运行指定的并行作业命令，如`yhalloc -N 2 yhrun -n 8 my_parallel_program`启动8个任务的并行程序。作业运行后，通过`yhacct --jobs=JOBID`获取作业ID和作业步ID，假设作业ID为123，作业步ID为0。然后用yhattach附接到作业步，`yhattach 123.0`可附接并获取所有任务的I/O数据，若要过滤特定任务，如只查看任务5的输出，使用`yhattach --output-filter=5 123.0`，还可添加`--label`参数在输出行前加上任务号以便区分，如`yhattach --label 123.0`。如此，即可通过yhattach实时获取并行作业的I/O数据，助力作业监控与调试。

For test case:

  - input: Prometheus 有哪些数据类型？其中Gauge指标如何通过 PromQL 查询指定数据类型的指标？
  - actual output: Prometheus 支持多种数据类型，主要包括 Gauge、Counter、Histogram 和 Summary。Gauge 类型用于表示可以增加或减少的指标，例如温度或内存使用量。Counter 类型用于表示单调递增的计数器，例如请求总数。Histogram 和 Summary 用于统计分布情况，例如请求延迟或响应大小。1. Prometheus 支持的数据类型包括 Gauge、Counter、Histogram 和 Summary。2. Gauge 类型的指标可以通过 PromQL 查询，例如使用 `gauge_metric_name` 直接查询具体的指标值。3. 在 PromQL 中，可以使用聚合操作符如 `avg()`、`max()` 或 `min()` 来对 Gauge 类型的指标进行计算和分析。
  - expected output: Prometheus有Counter（计数器）、Gauge（仪表盘）、Histogram（直方图）、Summary（摘要）等数据类型。Gauge指标用于表示可增可减的瞬时值，通过PromQL查询指定数据类型指标时，可直接利用指标名称配合筛选条件，例如要查询名为“cpu_usage_percent”的Gauge指标，可使用`cpu_usage_percent`，若需进一步筛选，如查询特定实例的该指标，则用`cpu_usage_percent{instance="localhost:9090"}`，以此精准获取所需的Gauge类型指标数据。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about two specific terms, 'yhacctmgr' and 'yhcontrol'. I am not familiar with these terms. However, if we consider them as potential typos or variations of known commands, they might refer to something related to system administration or programming. But without more context, it's hard to determine their exact meanings., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the functions of two specific tools or systems: yhacctmgr and yhcontrol. The retrieval contexts provided include a node on how to use YHWT (which includes yhcms) for managing accounts, but does not mention yhacctmgr or yhcontrol specifically. However, it mentions that users can manage multiple accounts with the same email by using different subdomains in the account management section. This is somewhat related as both tools are part of a system for user management and authentication, but they don't directly address the specific functions of yhacctmgr and yhcontrol. The node about YH-801 (yhcms) does not mention these terms at all. The other nodes might be irrelevant or unrelated to the query.', error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5416666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Albert Einstein's birthplace or nationality, focusing instead on his scientific achievements and awards., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: yhacctmgr和yhcontrol分别可以实现什么功能？
  - actual output: yhacctmgr 和 yhcontrol 是资源管理系统中的两个工具，各自具备不同的功能。yhacctmgr 主要用于管理账户、关联和集群配置，支持多种命令如添加、删除、显示和修改实体信息，同时可以设置账户的资源配额并导出/导入集群数据；yhcontrol 则主要用于控制和管理资源管理系统中的触发器，当特定事件发生时执行预定义的动作，例如运行脚本，支持基于节点状态、作业状态、时间限制等条件设置触发器，并可通过命令行选项查看、设置和删除触发器。1. yhacctmgr 的主要功能包括：1.1 管理账户、关联和集群配置，支持添加、删除、显示和修改实体信息。1.2 提供常用选项如显示帮助、不显示头信息、输出一行记录、静默模式、详细日志和版本信息等。1.3 支持设置账户的资源配额，如 CPU 分钟、作业数、节点数等，并可导出/导入集群数据。2. yhcontrol 的主要功能包括：2.1 设置和管理触发器，当特定事件（如节点状态变化、作业结束）发生时执行预定义动作，如运行脚本。2.2 支持基于节点状态、作业状态、时间限制等条件设置触发器，动作程序在管理节点上执行。2.3 提供命令行选项查看、设置和删除触发器，支持多种事件类型和参数配置。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score cannot be higher because there are statements in the actual output that do not relate to the topic of max_dirty_page_listeners or related topics, such as 'the sky is blue' which is completely unrelated., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided response, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about the difference between two parameters, max_dirty_mb_per_osc and max_dirty_mb_per_client. These are both related to memory management in Linux systems, specifically virtual memory statistics. The first parameter controls the maximum number of dirty pages per page cgroup for a specific control group (cgroup) while the second one is not valid or recognized as such., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.48, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context does not mention anything about max_dirty_mb_per_osc or max_dirty_mb_per_client, so it is irrelevant to the input question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: max_dirty_mb_per_osc和max_dirty_mb_per_client的参数作用有什么区别？
  - actual output: 综述：max_dirty_mb_per_osc和max_dirty_mb_per_client是Lustre文件系统中与数据写入缓存相关的参数，它们的作用区别主要体现在管理缓存的粒度和范围上。1.max_dirty_mb_per_osc用于限制每个OSS（Object Storage Server）实例的脏数据（即尚未写入磁盘的数据）的最大内存使用量，该参数通过控制单个OSS的缓存大小来避免内存资源过度占用，确保系统稳定性。2.max_dirty_mb_per_client则用于限制每个客户端（即访问Lustre文件系统的客户端）的脏数据最大内存使用量，该参数通过控制客户端侧的缓存大小来优化客户端性能并防止内存溢出。3.两者的区别在于作用对象不同，前者针对OSS服务端，后者针对客户端，因此在实际配置中需要根据具体场景调整以达到最佳性能和资源管理效果。
  - expected output: 在 Lustre 文件系统中，max_dirty_mb_per_osc和max_dirty_mb_per_client是两个用于控制数据写入缓存的参数，它们的作用存在明显区别。max_dirty_mb_per_osc主要用于限制每个 OSC（对象存储客户端）节点上的脏数据量，即每个 OSC 节点在将数据写入磁盘前，允许缓存的最大脏数据量，这一参数主要是从单个 OSC 节点的角度来控制数据缓存量，避免单个节点缓存过多数据导致系统性能问题。而max_dirty_mb_per_client则是用于限制每个客户端的脏数据量，即每个客户端在数据写入磁盘前可缓存的最大脏数据量，它是从客户端的维度来进行控制，确保每个客户端不会因缓存过多脏数据而影响系统整体运行。两者分别从 OSC 节点和客户端两个不同维度对脏数据量进行限制，共同保障系统的稳定和性能。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not directly address the user's query regarding the role of 'xattr' in Linux systems and how to disable it. It only describes general information about xattrs, which is too vague and doesn't specify the context (e.g., macOS or Linux) or provide specific steps for disabling., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided answer, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not provide sufficient context or explanation regarding the specific function of the xattr_cache parameter in relation to LSoM data access. The first context has some relevance but lacks detailed explanation, while the second is completely unrelated., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5416666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about xattr or Linux filesystems, and instead focuses on Albert Einstein's biography., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: xattr_cache 参数的作用是什么？当前在客户端上通过xattr接口访问LSoM数据时，如何禁用该参数？
  - actual output: xattr_cache 参数的作用是缓存通过 xattr 接口访问的 LSoM 数据，以提高访问效率，但可能导致数据过时。当前在客户端上通过 xattr 接口访问 LSoM 数据时，可以通过以下方式禁用该参数：1. 在客户端上使用命令 `lctl set param llite.*.xattr_cache=0` 来禁用 xattr 缓存，这将导致每次访问文件时不再使用缓存，从而可能增加额外的开销；2. 如果需要访问过时的最近 LSoM 数据，可以在客户端通过 `lctl set_param dlm.namespaces.xmqdqcx.1LIru size=clear` 取消 MDC 锁定，刷新 xattr 缓存；3. 通常建议在不需要频繁访问 LSoM 数据或对数据准确性要求较高的场景下禁用 xattr_cache，以确保获取最新的文件大小和块计数信息。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，`xattr_cache`参数用于控制客户端对扩展属性（xattr）的缓存行为，特别是在通过xattr接口访问LSoM（Lazy Size of MDT）数据时，该参数决定了LSoM数据在客户端的缓存状态。当`xattr_cache`启用时，客户端会缓存LSoM数据以提高后续访问效率，但这也可能导致数据过时，尤其是在文件大小频繁变更时。若需禁用该参数以确保获取最新的LSoM数据，可在客户端上执行`lctl set param llite.*.xattr_cache=0`命令。此操作会关闭客户端对xattr数据的缓存功能，使得每次访问LSoM数据时都直接从MDT获取最新信息，避免因缓存导致的数据不一致问题。需注意，禁用`xattr_cache`可能会增加网络开销，因为每次访问都需重新获取数据，而非读取缓存。

Lustre 文件系统并没有机制能够缓解硬件存储改隐。当服务融无法访问或终止服务时，将无法访问文件。Lustre 2.11 中引入了 Lustre 文件级元余 (FLR) 功能，任何 Lustre 文件都可将相同的数据存储在多台 OST 上，以提升系统在存储故障或其它故障发生时的稳健性。在存在多个针像的情况下，可选择最合适的镜像来啊应单个请求，这对 IO 可用性有直接影啊。此外，对于许多客户闯同时读取的文件〈如输入版，共孚库或可执行文件)，可以通过创建文件数据的多个镜像来提高单个文件的并行聚合读取性能。第一阶段的FLR 功能通过延迟写入实现〈如"图 21.1 FLR EIR GA" 所示)。在写入镜像文件时，只有一个主镜像或首选镜像在写入过程中直接更新，而其他镜像将被标记为stale。通过使用命令行工具《由用户或管理员直接运行或通过目动监控工具运行)同步各镜像之间同步，该文件可在随后再次写入其它镜像。Object j (primary, preferred)delayed resync图 25: FLR delay writting图', 'root@ossl# lctl set param obdfilter.*.readcache max filesize=32MteaX{£ OST 上禁用readcache max filesize，请运行:root@ossl# lctl set param obdfilter. {OST name}.readcache max filesize=-1l查看是否 OSS 的所有0OST Laila FA freadcache max filesize，请运行:root@ossl# lctl get param obdfilter.*.readcache max filesize39.4.4. 启用 OSS 异步日志提交OSS 异步日志提交功能将数据异步地写入磁盘，而不强制进行日志刷新。这将减少搜索次数，并显著提高了某些硬件的性能。注意异步日志提交不能用于直接的 IO 发起的写入〈设置了oO_DIRECT标志)。在这种情况下，将强制执行日志刷新。局用异步日志提交功能后，客户端节点会将数据保留在页面绥存中《页面引用)。Lustre 客户端将监视从 OSS 发送到客户端的消息中的最后提交的交易号 (transno)。当客户端看到 OSS 报告的最后一个提交的tr*ansno至少等于批量写入的trzansno时，它会在相应的页面上释放引用。为避免批量写入后客户端上的页面引用时间过长，在收到批量写入的回复后将发起 7 秒的 ping XK (OSS 文件系统提交默认时间间隔为 3 BD),以便 OSS 报告最后提交的transno。如果 OSS 在日志提交之前崩溃，则中间数据将丢失。但是，结合异步日志提交的OSS 恢复功能能够使客户端重放其写入请求，并通过恢复文件系统的状态来补偿丢失的磁盘更新。默认情况下，sync_journal为启用状态 (sync_journal=1)，以便同步提交日记条目。局用异步日志提交，请输入以下内容将sync_journal参数设置为 0:—$ lctl set_param obdfilter.*.sync_journal=02 obdfilter.lol-OST0001.sync_journal=0AKA sync-on-lock-cancel 功能〈黑认司用) WRIT 2 he Pi Be BS入对象的交叉区域后的 OSS 及其中一个客户端朋省时可能导致的数据不一致问题。当违反连续写入的', '脚本通毅会使用通配符“或文件系统专用的通配符 fname-* 来统一指定所有客户端上的参数设置。比如说1 lctl get_param osc.testfs-OST0000-osc-fffF88107412f400.rpc_ stats2 osc.testfs-OST0000-osc-ffff88107412F400.rpc_stats=3 snapshot time: 1375743284 .337839 (secs.usecs)4 read RPCs in flight: 05 write RPCs in flight: 039.4.2. 文件 Readahead 和目录 Statahead 的调试文件 readahead 和目录 statahead 人允许在进程请求数据之前将数据读入内存。文件readahead 将文件内容预取到内存中以进行与ead () 相关调用，而目录 statahead 将文件元数据提取到内存中以进行readqir ()和stat ()相关调用。当 readahead 和 statahead运行良好时，访问数据的进程可在请求时立即在客户端的内存中获取所需的信息，而没有网络 IO HEIR.39.4.2.1. 文件 Readahead = *4 Linux 绥神区高速缓存中的数据无法满足应用程序的两个或更多顺序读取时，将触发文件 readahead。初始预读的大小由 RPC 大小和文件条市大小决定，通首至少为1 MB ，附加的预读将线性增长并递增，直到客户端上的预读绥存到达了每个文件或每个系统的预置量绥存限制。Readahead 相关可调参数有:* llite.fsname-instance.max read ahead mb 一用于控制文件预读的最大数据量。在文件描述符上第二次顺序读取之后，预读文件至 RPC 大小的块(4MiB 或更大的read () 大小) 中。随机读取的大小只能为reaq () 调用大小《无TSE) 。读取文件至非连续区域会重置预读算法，并且在再次顺序读取之前不会再次触发预读。493\nLustre 文件系统操作于册 译者:DCZR At这是对所有文件的全局限制，不能大于客户端RAM 的12。要禁用 readahead, tf设置max_ read ahead mb=0。* llite.fsname instance.max read ahead per file mb一当获取到文件上的读取顺序时，用于控制']

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided by the user is incorrect because it fails to address the question directly and provides an explanation that is unrelated to the query about the difference between 'ost_tbf_rule' and 'mdt_tbf_rule'. The response should have explained what these terms mean, their differences, or how they relate to each other in a specific context. Instead, it only gives a generic answer without addressing the core of the question., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the difference between two parameters, `ostf_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`, which appear to be typos or variations of a common term. The original query mentions `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` but then uses `ost_tbf` and `mdt_tbf`. I suspect the user meant `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank` respectively, as these are likely typos or autocorrect errors in the input. However, to proceed with answering, I'll assume they mean `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`. The user is asking about two parameters that seem related but have different acronyms: one starting with 'ost' and the other with 'mdt'. These are likely typos or autocorrect errors. Since I don't have specific context, I'll provide a general explanation based on common patterns in programming contexts.

In software development, especially in frameworks like React, `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` might refer to something related to state management or routing (if 'ost' is meant to be 'other'). Similarly, `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank` could relate to data handling or another component. But without specific context, it's hard to determine the exact meaning.

The user likely wants a comparison between these two parameters in terms of their function and usage. I'll provide a general explanation based on common naming conventions:

- `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` (assuming corrected) might be related to handling state or object-related changes, while `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank` could relate to data transformation or business logic.

However, note that the user's query has typos. The correct terms should probably be `ost_tbf_rule_change_rank` and `mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`. I'll proceed with this assumption for clarity., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.56, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not mention anything about "ost_tbf_rule_change_rank" or "mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank", so it cannot be determined., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: ost_tbf_rule_change_rank和mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank的参数作用有什么区别？
  - actual output: ost_tbf_rule_change_rank和mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank的参数作用主要区别在于应用的组件和规则类型，具体如下：1. 应用组件不同：ost_tbf_rule_change_rank用于在OST（Object Storage Target）上调整TBF（Token Bucket Filter）规则的优先级，而mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank用于在MDT（Metadata Target）上调整TBF规则的优先级。2. 规则类型不同：ost_tbf_rule_change_rank通常涉及更复杂的条件表达式，支持逻辑与、逻辑或等操作，适用于对RPC请求进行更精细的分类；而mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank主要用于基于GID、NID或Opcode的规则调整，适用于对元数据操作的速率控制。3. 设置方法不同：ost_tbf_rule_change_rank需要先将nrs_policies设置为tbf opcode或tbf general，而mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank需要先将nrs_policies设置为tbf gid、tbf nid或tbf opcode，不同的策略类型对应不同的配置步骤。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，`ost_tbf_rule_change_rank`和`mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`均用于调整TBF（Token Bucket Filter）规则的优先级，但两者作用对象不同。`ost_tbf_rule_change_rank`针对OST（对象存储目标）服务的TBF规则，用于修改OST上已创建规则的排序，影响OST处理RPC请求时的规则匹配顺序；`mdt_tbf_rule_change_rank`则针对MDT（元数据目标）服务的TBF规则，用于调整MDT上规则的优先级，决定MDT在处理元数据相关请求时规则的应用顺序。两者均通过`lctl set param`命令配合`rank=`参数实现规则重排序，例如`lctl set_param ost.OSS.ost_io.nrs_tbf_rule="change rule_name rank=target_rule_name"`，但分别作用于OST和MDT服务，以实现对数据存储和元数据操作的流量控制策略优先级调整。

  - input: 管理员发现 Lustre 文件系统中部分数据对象频繁出现锁竞争导致性能下降，可以通过哪些参数配置调整锁竞争检测阈值及竞争状态持续时间？
  - actual output: 综述：管理员可以通过调整Lustre文件系统的相关参数来优化锁竞争问题，这些参数包括设置锁竞争检测阈值和竞争状态持续时间。1. ost_contention_seconds 参数用于设置OST资源在LDLM锁数目降下来后，仍保持在竞争状态的时间，通过调整该参数可以控制锁竞争状态的持续时间。2. ost_lwp_contention_seconds 参数用于设置LWP资源在LDLM锁数目降下来后，仍保持在竞争状态的时间，同样可以用来调整竞争状态的持续时间。3. osc_contention_seconds 参数用于设置资源在OSC竞争状态下保持的时间，通过调整该参数可以控制锁竞争的持续时间。4. ost_max_nolock_bytes 和 ost_lwp_max_nolock_bytes 参数分别用于设置无锁MO所允许的最大请求字节数，通过调整这些参数可以减少锁竞争的发生。5. ost_brw_size 参数用于设置读写操作的大小，合理配置该参数有助于减少锁竞争的情况。6. 除了上述参数外，还可以通过调整网络请求调度策略如ost_nrs_policies 和 mdt_nrs_policies 来优化系统性能，从而间接减少锁竞争的问题。7. 调整客户端元数据RPC流的参数如 max_rpcs_in_flight 和 max_mod_rpcs_in_flight 可以优化并行元数据操作的数量，从而降低锁竞争的可能性。8. 使用 sync_on_lock_cancel 参数控制在锁取消时是否同步日志，避免数据不一致，同时也可以影响锁竞争的状态。9. 通过监控和分析配额统计信息，如 quota_ctl 和 adjust_qunit 等事件，可以帮助管理员了解锁竞争的具体情况，并据此调整相关参数。10. 在 Lustre 的可调参数全解中还提到了其他与资源竞争控制相关的参数，如 qos_threshold_rr 和 qos_prio_free，这些参数也可以用来优化锁竞争问题。
  - expected output: 当Lustre文件系统中出现数据对象频繁锁竞争导致性能下降时，可通过以下参数调整锁竞争检测阈值及竞争状态持续时间来缓解。首先，`ost_contended_locks`参数用于设置判定数据对象处于竞争状态的锁数量阈值，默认情况下，当对象的LDLM锁数量达到或超过该值时，会被认定为竞争状态，例如将其设为32可调整竞争检测的敏感度。其次，`ost_contention_seconds`参数用于设置OST资源在锁数目降至阈值以下后，仍保持竞争状态的时间，默认情况下，即使锁数量减少，系统仍会在该时间段内维持竞争状态标记，可根据需求将其设为合适值如10秒，以避免频繁切换竞争状态。此外，`ost_lwp_contended_locks`和`ost_lwp_contention_seconds`参数分别用于LWP对象的竞争锁数量阈值和竞争状态持续时间设置，调整方式与上述参数类似。通过合理配置这些参数，可更精准地检测锁竞争情况并控制竞争状态持续时间，从而优化系统性能。

  - input: 某 Lustre 集群需优化故障恢复效率，管理员计划启用祈使式恢复（Imperative Recovery）机制，并调整恢复窗口以缩短客户端重连时间。需要配置哪些参数？
  - actual output: 为了优化Lustre集群的故障恢复效率并启用祈使式恢复（Imperative Recovery）机制，同时调整恢复窗口以缩短客户端重连时间，需要配置以下参数：1. imperative_recovery factor 参数用于设置祈使式恢复的恢复窗口，通过factor调整超时时间，提高系统可用性，默认值为5，可设置为1到101之间的值，例如设置为8表示将强制恢复超时设置为目标上正常恢复超时的80%。2. 对于所有OST（Object Storage Target）需要将obdfilter.{{ service name }}.ir_factor设置为指定的factor值，对于所有MDT（Metadata Target）需要将mdt.{{ service name }}.ir_factor设置为指定的factor值，对于MGS（Management Group Server）需要将mdt.{{ filesystem.fsname }}-MDT*.ir_factor和obdfilter.{{ filesystem.fsname }}-OST*.ir_factor设置为指定的factor值。3. 确保MGS节点与MDS节点分开，以避免在MDS/MGS故障的情况下无法使用祈使式恢复机制，同时在MGS重启时配置禁用IR的时间间隔，以确保客户端能够正确接收服务器重新启动的通知。
  - expected output: 在Lustre集群中优化故障恢复效率，启用祈使式恢复（Imperative Recovery）机制并调整恢复窗口以缩短客户端重连时间，需配置以下参数：首先是`imperative_recovery_factor`（或`ir_factor`）参数，其作用是设置祈使式恢复的恢复窗口，通过该参数可调整恢复超时时长，新的超时时长计算公式为“recovery time * factor / 10”，其中`factor`取值范围在[1, 101]之间，默认值为5，例如将其设为8时，强制恢复超时为正常恢复超时的80%。配置时，需将所有OST的`obdfilter.{{service name}}.ir_factor`、所有MDT的`mdt.{{service name}}.ir_factor`以及MGS的`mdqt.{{filesystem.fsname}}-MDT*.ir_factor`和`obdfilter.{{filesystem.fsname}}-OST*.ir_factor`设置为合适的`factor`值。此外，还需确保MGS节点与MDS节点分离，以保障祈使式恢复机制的有效性，因为MGS在恢复过程中至关重要，若MGS位于MDS节点上，MDS/MGS故障时无法使用该机制，客户端只能依赖基于超时的恢复。通过合理配置这些参数，可有效缩短客户端重连时间，提升集群故障恢复效率。

  - input: statahead机制通常会预取文件的元数据。文件的元数据存储在Lustre的MDT上，但文件的大小和其消耗的空间则由OST决定。如何开启 statahead_agl参数，开启后会影响什么？
  - actual output: 开启statahead_agl参数可以通过命令行工具lctl进行设置，该参数控制目录statahead线程预取文件大小或块属性的行为。开启后会影响目录遍历性能和元数据获取效率，同时可能对系统资源产生一定影响。1. 开启statahead_agl参数的方法是使用lctl命令，具体格式为“lctl set Param llite.*.statahead_agl=1”，其中“llite.*”表示所有客户端实例，而“statahead_agl=1”表示启用AGL行为。2. 开启statahead_agl参数后，目录statahead线程会从OST预取文件大小或块属性，以便应用程序需要时能够快速获取这些信息，从而提高目录遍历的性能。3. 开启statahead_agl参数可能会增加系统内存的使用，因为预取的数据需要存储在内存中。此外，如果statahead被禁用，AGL行为也会被禁用，这可能导致目录遍历性能下降。4. statahead_agl参数的默认值为1，表示启用AGL行为。如果需要禁用AGL行为，可以将参数设置为0，即“lctl set Param llite.*.statahead_agl=0”。5. 在实际应用中，是否开启statahead_agl参数取决于具体的使用场景和性能需求。如果目录遍历频繁且对性能要求较高，建议开启该参数；否则，可以考虑关闭以节省系统资源。6. 开启statahead_agl参数后，可以通过“lctl get Param llite.*.statahead_agl”命令查看当前的设置状态，确保参数已正确生效。7. 在某些情况下，如果发现开启statahead_agl参数导致系统性能下降或资源占用过高，可以适当调整参数值或关闭该功能，以达到最佳的系统性能和稳定性。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，`statahead_agl`参数与目录`statahead`机制配合，用于控制异步glimpse锁（AGL）的行为，开启该参数需在客户端执行`lctl set param llite.*.statahead_agl=1`（默认情况下`statahead_agl`为禁用状态，值为0，启用时需显式设置为1）。开启`statahead_agl`后，`statahead`线程会从OST预取文件大小、块属性等数据，并构建inode的AGL，这使得应用程序在访问文件时能更快获取元数据及存储在OST上的文件大小、空间消耗等信息，减少对OST的实时查询，提升目录遍历和元数据操作的效率。但需注意，AGL处理依赖于`statahead`线程构建的inode，若禁用`statahead`，`statahead_agl`也会随之失效，且开启后可能增加客户端与MDT、OST之间的通信开销，需根据实际工作负载调整。

  - actual output: 配置HTCondor并启动HTCondor服务的步骤如下：1. 安装HTCondor，通过wget下载源码并解压，使用build-on-linux.sh脚本编译生成deb包进行安装，安装完成后需要修改配置文件，设置CONDOR_HOST为manager node的IP地址，并根据需求配置DAEMON_LIST和其他权限参数。2. 启动HTCondor服务，执行systemctl start condor命令，检查进程是否正常运行，确保包含condor_master、condor_collector、condor_negotiator、condor_startd和condor_schedd等关键进程。3. 根据不同的节点角色启动相应的服务组合，例如manager node、submit node或execute node，分别对应不同的进程组合。4. 配置专用调度器，将DedicatedScheduler属性添加到机器的classad中，重启Condor服务，并编写提交脚本，使用parallel宇宙类型提交作业，指定执行命令并设置机器数量。5. 提交作业时需编写.sub文件，指定可执行文件、日志路径等信息，并使用condor_submit命令提交任务，支持普通用户提交作业及并行任务配置。6. 如果需要开启代理，执行特定的脚本并加载模块以配置代理环境。
  - expected output: 配置HTCondor并启动服务需按以下步骤进行：首先下载源码，使用wget获取condor_src-8.8.9-all-all.tar.gz并解压，进入解压目录后，在Ubuntu ARM系统中通过apt install devscripts安装相关工具，执行./build-on-linux.sh脚本编译生成deb包，再使用dpkg -i安装生成的deb包。接着修改配置文件，编辑/etc/condor/condor_config，添加CONDOR_HOST为manager节点IP，设置DAEMON_LIST为COLLECTOR MASTER NEGOTIATOR SCHEDD STARTD，并配置一系列ALLOW权限参数，如ALLOW_WRITE、ALLOW_READ等，同时指定QUEUE_SUPER_USERS为root和condor。配置完成后，使用systemctl start condor启动服务，通过ps -ef | grep condor_查看进程，若存在condor_master、condor_collector、condor_negotiator、condor_schedd、condor_startd等进程则表示启动成功。根据节点功能不同，启动的进程组合不同，如manager、submit和execute节点需启动condor_master、condor_collector、condor_negotiator、condor_schedd、condor_startd，仅manager节点需启动condor_master、condor_collector、condor_negotiator，仅submit节点需启动condor_master、condor_schedd，仅execute节点需启动condor_master、condor_startd。此外，若需配置专用调度器，需在计算节点新增配置文件，添加相关设置后重启Condor服务，并编写提交脚本，如使用parallel宇宙，指定可执行文件、参数、机器数量等，最后用condor_submit提交作业。

  - input: mdc_max_rpcs_in_flight和 osc_max_rpcs_in_flight参数的功能是什么？
  - actual output: mdc_max_rpcs_in_flight和osc_max_rpcs_in_flight参数的功能是控制客户端并行发送到MDT目标的元数据RPC和对象存储控制器（OSC）的读写RPC的最大数量，以优化性能和资源利用。1.mdc_max_rpcs_in_flight参数用于定义客户端并行发送到MDT目标的元数据RPC的最大数量，包括所有元数据操作如文件或目录统计、创建、取消链接等，其默认值为8，最小值为1，最大值为256。2.osc_max_rpcs_in_flight参数用于定义客户端并行发送到OSC的读写RPC的最大数量，适用于批量读取和写入操作，通过控制并发RPC数量来提高吞吐量和减少磁盘查找操作。3.这两个参数的设置需要根据具体的工作负载和系统配置进行调整，确保不会超过服务器端的限制，例如MDT的max_mod_rpcs_per_client参数，否则设置将失败并记录错误信息。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，`mdc_max_rpcs_in_flight`和`osc_max_rpcs_in_flight`参数分别用于控制客户端与不同目标之间的并行RPC请求数量，以优化系统性能和资源利用。其中，`mdc_max_rpcs_in_flight`用于设置客户端向MDT（元数据目标）发送的并行元数据RPC请求的最大数量，涵盖文件或目录统计、创建、删除等所有元数据操作，其默认值为8，取值范围为1到256，合理调整该参数可平衡元数据操作的并发度与系统资源消耗，例如在元数据密集型工作负载下适当增大该值可提升操作效率，但需注意避免因设置过大导致客户端和MDS内存消耗过高。`osc_max_rpcs_in_flight`则用于控制客户端向OST（对象存储目标）发送的并行数据RPC请求的最大数量，主要涉及数据的读写等操作，该参数的设置会影响数据传输的并发能力，较大的数值可提高数据吞吐量，但同样需考虑网络和存储资源的承受能力，避免因并发过高导致请求超时或系统性能下降。通过合理配置这两个参数，可根据集群的工作负载特性优化RPC请求的并行度，提升Lustre文件系统的整体性能。

For test case:

  - input: 管理员发现 Lustre 集群在高负载时频繁出现 RPC 超时，需通过调整自适应超时机制的历史记录时长和提前回复增量时间，优化客户端与服务器的超时响应策略，应该配置哪些参数？
  - actual output: 管理员需要调整自适应超时机制中的历史记录时长和提前回复增量时间，以优化客户端与服务器的超时响应策略，应配置以下参数：1. at_history 参数用于设置自适应超时记忆的发生最慢事件的时间段，该参数的默认值为600秒，可以通过调整此参数来改变历史记录时长。2. at_early_margin 参数用于设置超过该时间后，Lustre 服务需将发送早期回复的时间，该参数的默认值为5秒，通过调整此参数可以控制提前回复增量时间。3. at_max 参数用于设置自适应超时的最大值，即服务估计时间的上限，如果将at_max设置为0，则表示禁用自适应超时，转而采用固定超时时间设置方法。
  - expected output: 在Lustre集群中，当高负载导致频繁RPC超时，可通过调整自适应超时机制的相关参数优化客户端与服务器的超时响应策略。其中，`at_history`参数用于设置自适应超时记忆的最慢事件时间段（单位：秒），默认值为600，增大该值可使系统基于更长时间的历史数据调整超时阈值，避免因短期波动导致的误判；`at_early_margin`参数用于设置超过该时间后，Lustre服务器发送早期回复的时间（单位：秒），默认值为5，合理增加该值可让服务器更早发送早期回复，避免客户端因等待过久而触发超时重连。具体配置时，可通过`lctl set param`命令进行调整，例如`lctl set param testfs.sys.at_history=1200`和`lctl set param testfs.sys.at_early_margin=10`，同时需注意在MGS上使用`lctl conf param`命令进行系统范围的永久设置，以确保参数生效并优化集群在高负载下的超时响应能力。

  - input: 在Lustre文件系统中，如何利用lnetctl工具进行网络配置的导入、导出及流量数据查看？
  - actual output: 在Lustre文件系统中，可以利用lnetctl工具进行网络配置的导入、导出及流量数据查看，具体方法如下：1. 导入网络配置：通过`lnetctl import`命令可以导入YAML格式的配置文件，支持添加、删除或显示操作。例如，使用`lnetctl import --del FILE.yaml`可以删除配置项，而`lnetctl import --show FILE.yaml`则用于显示配置内容。2. 导出网络配置：使用`lnetctl export`命令可以将当前配置导出为YAML格式文件，如`lnetctl export FILE.yaml`或`lnetctl export > FILE.yaml`。3. 查看流量数据：通过`lnetctl stats show`命令可以显示LNet的流量统计数据，帮助监控和分析网络性能。此外，YAML文件支持对网络、接口、路由等配置进行详细描述，并且可以通过`lnetctl`工具处理这些配置文件中的项目。LNet参数通常在`/etc/modprobe.d/lustre.conf`中设置，用于配置NICs和路由，NID（网络标识符）用于唯一标识节点，格式为`IP@network_type`，如`10.67.73.200@tcp`。用户可通过`lctl list nids`查看NID信息。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，利用lnetctl工具进行网络配置导入时，可使用lnetctl import命令，若要删除配置项需添加--del选项，如lnetctl import --del FILE.yaml或lnetctl import --del < FILE.yaml，而`netctl import --show FILE.yaml或lnetctl import --show < FILE.yaml可用于查看YAML文件中描述的所有项；导出网络配置时，通过lnetctl export FILE.yaml或lnetctl export > FILE.yaml命令可将配置导出为YAML格式文件；查看流量数据时，执行lnetctl stats show命令即可输出LNet流量数据信息，且YAML文件支持对网络、接口、路由等配置进行添加、删除和显示操作，其网络、路由和路由表的YAML块包含相关统计数据信息，每个序列带seq_no字段，便于在错误块中返回以定位问题。

  - input: 在Lustre文件系统中，如何处理OST降级状态以避免影响整体性能？请说明标记OST降级的操作步骤及相关参数配置。
  - actual output: 在Lustre文件系统中，处理OST降级状态以避免影响整体性能主要通过标记OST为降级模式，并配置相关参数来实现。具体操作步骤和参数配置如下：1. 标记OST降级的操作步骤包括使用`lctl set_param obdfilter.{OST name}.degraded=1`命令将OST标记为降级状态，这样MDS将不再为其分配新对象，从而避免因OST降级导致的全局性能下降。2. 恢复OST正常模式的操作步骤是运行`lctl set_param obdfilter.{OST name}.degraded=0`命令，将OST从降级状态恢复为正常状态。3. 可以通过`lctl get_param obdfilter.*.degraded`命令检查当前处于降级模式的OST。此外，当OST因重启或其他状况被重新挂载时，其降级标志会被自动重置为0。在配置方面，可以通过`--param="failover.mode=failout"`选项指定故障切换模式为failout，这样Lustre客户端在超时后会立即接收到错误消息，而不是一直等待OST恢复，从而减少对整体性能的影响。同时，在格式化OST时，可以使用`mkfs.lustre`命令并添加`--replace`选项来替换故障OST，并确保配置文件的正确恢复，以维持文件系统的稳定运行。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中处理OST降级状态以避免影响整体性能，需先通过`lctl set_param obdfilter.{OST name}.degraded=1`标记OST为降级状态，此时MDS将不再为其分配新对象，避免因OST性能下降导致全局性能降低；若要恢复OST正常状态，可执行`lctl set_param obdfilter.{OST name}.degraded=0`。操作时需注意，OST因重启或其他状况重新挂载后，降级标志会重置为0，建议通过自动脚本（如利用MD-RAID的`mdadm`命令及`--monitor`）监控RAID设备状态，及时标记OST降级或恢复状态。此外，还可通过`lctl get_param obdfilter.*.degraded`查看当前处于降级模式的OST。

  - actual output:  为优化 Lustre 客户端在高并发环境下 LDLM 锁缓存不足的问题，需要调整与 LRU 缓存相关的参数。1. 可以通过调整 `brw_size` 和 `max_pages_per_rpc` 参数来优化批量 IO 性能，从而减少锁管理的压力。`brw_size` 控制 OST 上的最大 I/O 大小，而 `max_pages_per_rpc` 限制客户端发送的 RPC 大小，两者共同影响锁的获取和释放效率。2. 配置 `sync_on_lock_cancel` 参数可以控制在锁取消时是否同步日志，避免数据不一致问题，该参数可设置为 `always`、`blocking` 或 `never`，建议不要禁用此功能。3. 调整客户端元数据 RPC 流相关参数如 `max_rpcs_in_flight` 和 `max_mod_rpcs_in_flight`，用于控制并行元数据操作的数量，提升性能。此外，还可以使用 `lfs ladvise` 命令结合 `lockahead` 模式请求特定类型的锁，以优化服务器端缓存管理。这些参数和命令的合理配置有助于缓解 LDLM 锁缓存不足的问题，提高锁管理性能。
  - expected output: 在Lustre文件系统中，当客户端在高并发场景下出现LDLM锁缓存不足问题时，可通过调整LRU缓存相关参数优化锁缓存机制。主要需配置以下参数：一是`ldlm.lru_max_age`，该参数用于控制锁缓存中条目保留的最长时间（单位：秒），默认值为300，增大该值可延长锁缓存条目保留时间，减少因超时导致的缓存失效，例如设置为600以适应高并发场景；二是`ldlm.lru_min_age`，用于设置锁缓存条目的最小保留时间（单位：秒），默认值为60，合理调整可避免频繁淘汰仍在使用的锁缓存条目，如设为120以增强缓存稳定性；三是`ldlm.lru_max_entries`，用于指定锁缓存中最大条目数量，默认值为10000，根据并发量适当增大该值，如调整为20000，可增加锁缓存容量，减少缓存不足情况。通过调整这些参数，可优化LRU缓存机制，提升高并发场景下的锁管理性能。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question asks for a specific numerical value or count regarding the current state of computing nodes (nodes) on the system that are in a 'down' state, but the actual output provided does not provide any information about node status. It only describes general capabilities and services offered by the assistant without mentioning anything about the number of downed nodes., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking for the number of computing nodes currently on the system that are in a down state. The retrieval contexts provided include two entries: one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. However, the score is given as 1.00, which indicates perfect precision. This suggests that all retrieved documents or nodes are relevant to the query. But let's analyze each node separately.

The first context has a verdict of 'yes', meaning it is relevant. The second one has a verdict of 'no'. Since there are two contexts and one is relevant while the other is not, the precision score cannot be 1.0 unless both are considered equally relevant or if the system considers only the top-k retrieved nodes for calculation.

The user query is about counting down nodes, but the retrieval context does not provide any numerical value or specific information to answer that question directly. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding in the scoring criteria. The score of 1.0 implies all retrieved contexts are relevant, but based on content analysis, neither context provides a direct count or status update about how many nodes are down.

The first node (ranked higher) has verdict 'yes' and likely contains information that is positive for the query, while the second node has verdict 'no'. However, without specific details in either, it's hard to determine if they are both relevant. But since one of them is irrelevant, even if ranked above, precision cannot be 100% unless only one context was retrieved and it was deemed relevant.

The user might expect a direct answer like 'There are currently X nodes down' or something similar, but the retrieval contexts don't provide that information. The score should reflect how well the system is able to retrieve relevant documents given the query. Here, even though both contexts mention some aspect related to node status (e.g., one says yes and the other no), they do not directly answer the specific count or state of down nodes.

Therefore, I think there might be an error in the scoring or interpretation. The score is 1.0 only if all retrieved contexts are relevant, but here we have at least one irrelevant context (the 'no' verdict node). However, perhaps the system considers that both contexts are still somewhat related to the query? Or maybe the retrieval system returned two nodes and both were considered relevant for some reason.

But based on strict relevance, if there is a retrieved node with verdict 'no', then precision cannot be 1.0 unless all retrieved nodes are relevant. The score of 1.0 might indicate that the top-k contexts (if k=2) are all relevant, but in this case, one is irrelevant.

The user's query is about system status and node states, so both verdicts could be considered as related to the same topic. However, precision specifically measures how many of the retrieved items are relevant. With two nodes retrieved, one yes and one no, the precision for k=2 would not be 100% unless all retrieved contexts are relevant.

In conclusion, I think there is a mistake in the score assignment or retrieval process because an irrelevant node was included., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5357142857142857, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein or his birth, so it cannot be used to answer the question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统上有多少计算节点处于 down 状态？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，系统中计算节点的在线状态和相关配置参数有所提及，但未直接说明具体有多少节点处于离线状态。1. 文本中提到部分节点出现异常日志，如dmesg输出显示错误信息，涉及网络设备和内存分配问题，这可能表明这些节点存在故障或不稳定状态，但未明确指出具体数量。2. 在节点列表中，部分节点的状态被标记为“drain”，这通常表示节点正在维护或暂时不可用，但同样没有给出具体的节点数量。3. 虽然文本提到了计算节点的配置参数和安全策略设置，但并未提供关于当前离线节点的具体统计数据或明确说明。
  - expected output: 关于当前系统处于down状态的计算节点数量，执行 clush 命令检查了 cn [17408-17419 等大量节点的 dmesg 日志，发现如 cn17953 出现 ERR_PKT 错误、cn17955 等节点有 zni_dev 相关异常、cn18119 存在内存分配错误，但这些节点状态未明确标记为 down。结合运维经验，可通过以下方式排查：1. 执行sinfo -o "%N %t"命令，查看所有节点状态，筛选出状态为down的节点。2. 运行yhcontrol show node | grep -i "state=down"，获取系统中明确标记为down的计算节点列表及数量。3. 检查节点日志，执行clush -w all "dmesg | grep -i error"，通过异常日志判断是否有节点因故障处于down状态。4. 查看分区状态，使用sinfo -p ALL -o "%P %D %t"，分析各分区中是否存在处于down状态的节点。目前部分节点存在如网络设备错误、内存分配失败等异常日志（如cn17953、cn17955等节点的dmesg输出），且有操作记录显示对大量节点执行了状态检查，但未明确标注这些节点是否处于down状态。建议结合上述命令实时查询，以准确获取当前系统中处于down状态的计算节点数量。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['该文本描述了节点列表和相关系统状态信息，包括节点数量、核心数、分区状态等。部分节点出现异常日志，如dmesg输出显示错误信息，涉及网络设备和内存分配问题。同时，有操作记录显示取消了test预约并尝试释放节点。', '使用qe6.8在HPC4上进行两个节点的满核计算时，当核心数超过50个会报错。错误信息指出部分进程没有分配到平面，建议使用铅笔分解（-pd .true.）。该问题在72个核心时出现，且错误信息重复多次后导致程序终止。', '文本主要描述了计算节点的配置参数和相关安全策略设置，包括资源限制、分区配置、用户权限控制、SSH登录限制、日志管理以及镜像生成和更新流程。其中还提到计算节点使用三种内核版本：ft2k、ft3k 和 mt3k。', '18229-18259. 18261-18272. 18274-18334. 1833\n6-18362 18365-18366 18368-18371 18373-18379 18381-18382 . 18384-18398, 18400-18431]\n\nLroot@mn6 “1#\n取消test预约。\nCroot@mn6 “]# yhcontrol delete reservation=test\nCroot@mn6 “]# yhcontrol show reservation test\nReservation test not found\n14）放出节点\n检查节点dmesg，看看有无异常信息，执行：clush-w $nodelist"dmesg-T"\n[rootemn6“]# clush -wu cn[17408-17419.17421-17444.17446-17467.17469-17475.17478-17483.17485-17515.17517-17524.17526-17531.17533-175\n39.17541-17555.17557-17571.17573-17582.17584-17607.17616-17644.17646-17659.17661-17942.17953-17968.17970-17975.17977-17991.18000-180\n13.18015-18061.18063-18143.18148-18152.18154-18183.18192-18227.18229-18259.18261-18272.18274-18334.18336-18362.18365-18366.18368-183\n71.18373-18379.18381-18382.18384-18398.18400-18420.18429-18431] “dmesg -T"\n\ncn17953: [Tue May20221 zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _intr. new FPQ packet:\n\ncn17953: [Tue May2022] [ERR_PKT]: class=1:¥C0, type=2:¥P_ACCESS.\n\ncn17953: [Tue May2022] flit[00]: 0x0000142301100400.2801200000004000.0000618045062b49.38e2000135045081\n\ncn17953: [Tue May2022] flit[01]: 0x0000000000001647.fb74000000000000.000040000000001d.000000000061b978\n\ncn17955: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of Yp#24"s is not empty\n\ncn17987: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of Yp#24-s is not empty\n\ncn17989: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P', 'not empty\n\ncn17989: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P#24°s is not empty\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9250, 780d9260) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9270, 780d9280) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9280, 780d9290) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d9290, 780d92a0) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d92a0, 780d92b0) PFNs busy\n\ncn18119: [Tue May2022] alloc_contig_range: [780d92b0。780d92c0) PFNs busy\n\ncn18004: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of Yp#24-s is not empty\n\ncn18009: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P#24’s is not empty\n\ncn17966: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _wait_tp_dq_empty, after 85, DQ in TP of ¥P#24°s is not empty\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] zni_dev 0000:01:00.0: _intr。new FPQ packet\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] [ERR_PKT]: class=1:¥C0, type=2:¥P_ACCESS\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] flit[00]: 0x0000142301100400.0801200000000000.00006180450623fa.88e21001350450a7\n\ncn17967: [Tue May2022] flit[01]: 0x000000000000d777', 'Use pencil decomposition (-pd .true.)\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nstopping ...\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nError in routine  fft_type_set (6):\nthere are processes with no planes.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is asking for the top 5 most loaded nodes, but the assistant's response does not provide a clear list or ranking of the five highest-loaded nodes. It only mentions that there are multiple high-load nodes and provides general advice on handling load balancing without specifying which ones., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because the model sometimes provides accurate and relevant responses but often makes assumptions that aren't supported by the retrieval context, leading to inaccuracies or omissions., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking for the top five highest-grossing films of all time, but the retrieved contexts do not contain any information about film rankings or box office records. The provided contexts are irrelevant to this specific ranking question., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input query because it does not mention anything about node utilization or alarms, and instead focuses on Albert Einstein's biography and scientific achievements unrelated to the topic., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 目前负载最高的5台节点分别是哪些？负载是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前系统中负载最高的五台节点及其负载状态如下：1. 节点oss10的负载状态为Active，其ETH IP地址为25.8.103.10，挂载存储池包括ost60到ost65。2. 节点oss11的负载状态为Active，其ETH IP地址为25.8.103.11，挂载存储池包括ost66到ost71。3. 节点oss12的负载状态为Active，其ETH IP地址为25.8.103.12，挂载存储池包括ost72到ost77。4. 节点oss13的负载状态为Active，其ETH IP地址为25.8.103.13，挂载存储池包括ost78到ost83。5. 节点oss14的负载状态为Active，其ETH IP地址为25.8.103.14，挂载存储池包括ost84到ost89。
  - expected output: 数据库内图6-33展示了计算节点利用率的变化趋势，但未明确具体节点的负载数值；图6-34列出了未处理告警信息，涉及mn0到mn15等主机的warning级别告警，但未说明这些告警与负载的直接关系。根据经验，可通过以下方式获取负载最高的5台节点及负载值：1. 执行top -b -n 1 | grep "Cpu" | head -n 6命令，查看系统整体CPU使用情况。2. 使用ps -eo pid,ppid,user,%cpu,%mem,comm | sort -k4 -r | head命令，按CPU使用率排序，查看占用CPU较高的进程及所属节点。 3. 运行iostat -x 1 5命令，查看磁盘I/O情况，判断是否存在I/O高负载节点。4. 通过vmstat 1 5命令，监控内存和swap使用情况，确定内存高负载节点。5. 执行netstat -anp | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l命令，查看网络连接数，找出网络高负载节点。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about a specific system code or identifier '2561019'. I don't have any information about this. The assistant should not provide detailed explanations for questions it cannot answer, but simply state that they can help with other queries., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking about the nodes used in a specific system, but I don't have any information about what nodes are being referred to. The retrieval contexts provided do not mention anything related to node usage or system architecture details. Without more context or specific data, it's impossible to determine which nodes were used for this particular operation., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5416666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention Albert Einstein or his achievements, and only provides basic biographical details that are unrelated to the query about his birthplace., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 系统中正在运行的25610192作业使用了哪些节点？
  - actual output: 系统中正在运行的25610192作业使用了以下节点：1. cn[6144-6151,6160-6351,6360-6527,6536-6583,6592-6631,6640-6975,6984-7167]。
  - expected output: 2021 年 2 月 26 日的工作记录中明确提到作业 id 为 110480，使用的节点为cn[6144-6151,6160-6351,6360-6527,6536-6583,6592-6631,6640-6975,6984-7167]。若要确认当前系统中该作业是否仍在运行及节点使用情况，可结合运维经验进行操作：1. 执行squeue -j 110480命令，查看作业是否处于运行状态及当前分配的节点；若作业已完成，可使用 sacct -j 110480 -o NodeList获取历史运行节点信息。2. 通过查看 Slurm 日志文件（通常位于/var/log/slurm）进一步核实节点使用情况。若需实时监控作业节点状态，可利用已部署的 slurm-tools 工具，执行job_nodes 110480命令快速获取节点列表。通过以上操作，可准确掌握作业 110480 的节点使用情况。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is asking for a specific numerical value or information regarding the current number of Object Storage Targets (OSTs) mounted in the Lustre file system, but I don't have access to real-time data about your system configuration. However, I can provide general guidance on how to find this information., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score reflects a moderate level of alignment between the model's response and the provided retrieval context, indicating some accuracy but with significant deviations or omissions that may lead to inaccuracies., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking for the number of OSDs (Object Storage Devices) in a Lustre file system, which directly relates to how many OSTs are used. The retrieval contexts provided include one context with verdict 'yes' and reasons about the relationship between OSDs and OSTs being similar, but not identical, and another context with verdict 'no' that states they are different roles. However, since the user is asking for a specific number or configuration detail, neither response provides a direct answer to the question. The 'yes' node does not give a numerical value, only an analogy comparison, while the 'no' node directly answers but incorrectly identifies them as distinct entities. Neither context fully addresses the query's request for a specific count or confirmation of OSDs being OSTs., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.56, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein or his birth year, focusing instead on general statements about relativity and mentioning Lustre file system unrelated to him., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前 Lustre文件系统中挂载的OST数量是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，当前 Lustre 文件系统中挂载的 OST 数量无法直接确定，因为没有给出具体的数值或相关命令的输出结果。但可以提供以下相关信息：1. Lustre 文件系统操作手册中提到可以通过命令列出与每个 Lustre 挂载点关联的所有 Lustre 文件系统实例，如果提供了路径列表，则将给出相应的路径实例，如果某路径不是 Lustre 实例，则将返回“No such device”。2. 手册中还提到可以使用命令查看文件系统的所有 OST，如果指定了挂载 Lustre 文件系统的路径，则仅显示属于此文件系统的 OST。3. 此外，Lustre 文件系统支持条带化功能，用户可以通过命令设置文件的条带数量、大小和起始 OST，这可能间接反映 OST 的数量，但具体数值仍需通过实际命令查询。

The answer should have directly stated that it depends on various factors such as the type of storage (SSD vs HDD), interface speed, etc., rather than just providing general methods to check performance without addressing the question about identifying the fastest disk in a system., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点是哪台？
  - actual output: 根据提供的测试数据，当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点可以通过对比不同节点的DD写测试结果来确定。1. RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3的DD满写测试平均速度为630MB/s，而RHEL7.8+ZFS0.8.4的平均速度为555MB/s，这表明RHEL8.3版本在I/O性能上优于RHEL7.8。2. 在OSS存储池写测试中，每个节点上的6个存储池的平均写带宽被记录下来，这些数据通过图表展示，用于分析不同节点的性能表现。3. 具体的测试结果显示，oss4和oss5节点在RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3环境下，其DD写测试速度达到了630MB/s左右，而oss6和oss7节点在RHEL7.8+ZFS0.8.4环境下，其DD写测试速度约为555MB/s，因此可以推断oss4和oss5节点是当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点。

  - expected output: 通过DD满写测试对不同存储节点的磁盘IO性能进行了对比。在RHEL8.3+ZFS2.0.3环境下，oss4节点的多个存储池测试速度达到630MB/s以上，其中ost27存储池速度为636MB/s，ost24为644MB/s，ost25为643MB/s；oss5节点的存储池速度在626-632MB/s之间。而RHEL7.8+ZFS0.8.4环境下的oss6、oss7节点速度约为556-558MB/s。由此可见，oss4节点的磁盘IO速度在测试中表现突出。根据经验，若要确定当前系统中磁盘IO最快的存储节点，可进一步通过以下操作验证：1. 执行dd oflag=direct if=/dev/zero of=/ostX/ostX bs=4M命令，对各存储节点的不同存储池进行实时测试，记录各节点的读写速度。 2. 使用iostat -x 1命令，监控各存储节点的磁盘IOPS和吞吐量，获取更详细的IO性能数据。 3. 通过gluster volume status查看存储节点的实时负载情况，结合性能数据判断最快节点。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking about network speed, but the assistant's response does not provide any information related to '3F cluster' or specific details about its network speed. The response seems to be discussing general concepts of 3G and 4G networks without addressing the specific context of a 3F cluster., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided response, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking for the current network speed of a specific cluster (3F Cluster). The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information about the current network speed or performance metrics. There might be some confusion with the term "Contextual Precision Score" which seems to refer to an evaluation metric, but in this case, it's unclear what exactly is being referred to as there are no specific details given for a 3F cluster. The user may have misspelled 'score' or meant something else by 'Contextual Precision Score'. Without explicit data on the network speed of the 3F cluster from the retrieval contexts, I cannot provide an accurate answer., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5238095238095238, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein or his achievements, so it cannot be relevant to this question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 3F 集群此时的网络速度测试是多少？
  - actual output: 3F集群的网络传输速率测试结果基于osu-5.8程序进行，使用不同的mpi版本，测试节点为cn[2987-2988]，结果显示了不同数据大小下的带宽情况。1. 延时测试显示随着数据大小增加，延时显著上升，其中mpi-x在大部分情况下表现最佳，而mpi-n延时较高。2. 带宽测试表明，mpi-x在大尺寸数据下具有显著优势，例如在1048576字节时，mpi-x的带宽达到5503.29 MB/s，而mpi-x + tcp和mpi-n分别为681.39 MB/s和665.71 MB/s。3. 测试数据表明不同配置下的运行时间存在差异，具体结果如表格所示，但未提供具体的网络传输速率数值。

  - expected output: TH-3F 系统网络速度测试使用 osu-5.8 程序，基于 gcc9.3.0 编译，采用不同 mpi 版本（mpich/mpi-x-gcc9.3.0 + glex、mpich/mpi-x-gcc9.3.0 + tcp、mpich/mpi-n-gcc9.3.0 + tcp），在 cn [2987-2988] 节点进行测试。延时测试中，当数据 Size 为 0 时，mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n 的 Latency 分别为 4.53us、16.42us、28.08us；Size 为 4194304 时，延时分别为 1141.11us、6404.55us、6376.47us。带宽测试中，Size 为 1 时，mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n 的 Bandwidth 分别为 1.04MB/s、0.11MB/s、0.19MB/s；Size 为 4194304 时，带宽分别为 6956.75MB/s、650.1MB/s、655.16MB/s。由于文件中未提及当前 3F 集群网络速度的实时情况，若要获取当前 3F 集群网络速度，可参考以下方法：使用 osu - 5.8 程序测试：若 3F 集群环境允许再次使用该程序进行测试，需确认集群内有安装 osu - 5.8 程序且已基于 gcc9.3.0 编译。在合适的节点（如之前测试的 cn [2987 - 2988] 节点或根据集群网络架构确定的测试节点）上，运行相应的测试命令。对于延时测试，可执行类似osu_latency -m [mpi版本]的命令（将[mpi版本]替换为实际要测试的 mpi 版本，如 mpi - x、mpi - x + tcp、mpi - n 等）；对于带宽测试，可执行osu_bandwidth -m [mpi版本]的命令 。运行命令后，记录不同数据 Size 下的延时和带宽测试结果，以此获取当前 3F 集群网络速度情况。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about counting online maintenance nodes, but the actual output does not provide any information regarding node status or system maintenance. The answer should have been more specific and directly address the query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is lower because there's a contradiction between the user's claim and the retrieved information., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about the number of online computing nodes currently in maintenance status, and the retrieval contexts provided include two types: one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. The score is given as 1.00, which indicates a perfect match or maximum relevance. However, without specific details on how many are being maintained, I cannot provide an exact number., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about online system maintenance or offline systems., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统中在线的处于维护状态的计算节点有几个？目前维护状态通过标签maintenance="true"标记，且计算节点通过标签role="compute"区分。
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前系统中被标记为维护状态的计算节点数量无法直接得出，但可以列出相关线索和可能的解决方法：1. 文档中提到维护状态通过标签maintenance=\"true\"标记，而计算节点通过标签role=\"compute\"区分，这表明可以通过查询系统中同时满足这两个标签的节点来确定数量；2. 在内容部分提到了一些与节点管理相关的命令，例如yhq用于查看作业状态，yhcancel用于取消作业，yhdo用于重启节点的slurm进程等，这些命令可能间接涉及节点状态的查询；3. 有提到节点状态、利用率和告警信息的展示方式，例如图6-32展示了各分区不同状态的节点数，但具体数字未给出，因此无法直接获取维护状态的计算节点数量。

  - expected output: 数据库中图6-32展示了节点分区状态，包含alloc、down*、drain等状态，但未明确与maintenance="true"和role="compute"标签的对应关系，其他内容也未涉及通过标签标记维护状态节点的信息。根据经验，要查询系统中在线的处于维护状态的计算节点数量，可利用标签筛选功能来准确获取计算节点数量，具体步骤操作如下：    1. 执行kubectl get nodes --selector=role="compute",maintenance="true" -o json命令，获取符合标签条件的计算节点列表。    2. 利用oc get nodes结合标签筛选，查看处于维护状态的计算节点。    3. 通过集群管理工具的API接口，根据标签role="compute"和maintenance="true"查询节点状态。    4. 使用nodectl list --label role=compute --label maintenance=true命令（若系统支持），统计在线维护状态的计算节点数量。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['本文档介绍了多个用于管理和维护计算集群的命令，包括查看作业状态、取消作业、重启节点和进程、复位计算节点、重启计算板子、控制存储和网络设备状态等。此外，还涉及管理节点的基础配置，如远程IPM连接和Java环境的安装与配置。内容涵盖系统维护和监控的多个方面。', '文本主要介绍了系统中节点状态、利用率和告警信息的展示方式。图6-32展示了各分区不同状态的节点数，可通过拖动进度条调整显示的分区和数量。图6-33显示了计算节点利用率的变化趋势。图6-34列出了未处理告警信息，包括告警类型、服务、主机名称、级别和时间。此外，还提到了作业分布和资源态势的相关内容。', '本周工作主要包括计算节点和存储系统的维护与测试，如挂载文件系统、JBOD硬盘管理、Infiniband设置、编译和部署软件（如MVAPICH、MPICH、DAOS等），以及性能测试（如IOR、Linpack）。同时，处理了多个系统问题，如库文件缺失、软链接失败、内核版本更新等。此外，还进行了文档整理、服务器状态统计和团队协作任务。', '部署mpich-3.2.1-static/shared版本\n3.

  - input: 目前内存使用率最高的 3 台节点分别是哪些？内存占用量是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前内存使用率最高的节点可以通过内存使用情况的数据进行分析，以下是具体节点及其内存占用情况：1. cn[3876,3888] 节点的内存总量为124MB，已用内存为21MB，空闲内存为101MB，共享内存为1MB，缓冲/缓存为1MB，可用内存为101MB。2. cn[768,1648] 节点的内存总量为124MB，已用内存为25MB，空闲内存为96MB，共享内存为2MB，缓冲/缓存为2MB，可用内存为95MB。3. cn[738,2553] 节点的内存总量为124MB，已用内存为24MB，空闲内存为98MB，共享内存为1MB，缓冲/缓存为1MB，可用内存为97MB。

  - expected output: 多个节点的内存使用情况：cn[3876,3888]：内存总量124，已用21，空闲101，共享1，缓冲/缓存1，可用101；cn[738,2553]：内存总量124，已用24，空闲98，共享1，缓冲/缓存1，可用97；cn[768,1648]：内存总量124，已用25，空闲96，共享2，缓冲/缓存2，可用95；cn6153：内存总量61，已用15，空闲41，共享4，缓冲/缓存4，可用41；cn10483：内存总量61，已用16，空闲43，共享0，缓冲/缓存1，可用43；cn8198：内存总量61，已用16，空闲44，共享1，缓冲/缓存1，可用44。从这些数据可以看出，内存使用率最高的3台节点及内存占用量分别为：cn[768,1648]：已用内存25，在总量124的节点中占用比例相对较高； cn[738,2553]：已用内存24。cn[3876,3888]：已用内存21。根据经验，若要准确获取当前系统中内存使用率最高的节点及占用量，可通过以下操作：    1. 执行top -b -n 1 | grep "Mem"命令，查看系统整体内存使用情况，同时按P键以CPU使用率排序，再按M键切换到以内存使用率排序，可直观看到各进程占用内存情况及所属节点。    2. 使用free -h命令，查看各节点内存的总量、已用、空闲等详细信息。    3. 对于远程节点，可通过ssh node_name free -h命令登录到具体节点查看其内存使用情况。    4. 利用监控工具如Prometheus，设置内存使用率的监控指标，查询当前内存使用率最高的3台节点及其占用量。

  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，查询 user2 提交的所有已完成作业并列出各作业的完成时间，可以总结如下：1. 提供的信息中没有直接提到 user2 提交的作业记录，因此无法确定 user2 的具体作业信息。2. 文本中提到的作业信息主要涉及其他用户，例如 zhenggang4 和 clusterw，而普通账号只能查看自身作业，因此 user2 的作业可能不在当前数据范围内。3. 如果 user2 是普通用户，则需要使用 pestat 或 seff 命令来查看其作业状态和完成时间，但当前数据中未提供相关命令的执行结果或作业 ID。

  - expected output: 可以通过pestat -u user2查询用户作业，seff <作业ID>查看作业详细信息。根据经验，在Linux系统中查询user2提交的已完成作业及完成时间，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 执行sacct -u user2 -S 2024-01-01 -E 2024-12-31 - state COMPLETED命令，查询user2在指定时间范围内已完成的作业，该命令会显示作业ID、开始时间、结束时间等信息。    2. 使用pestat -u user2 -E选项，查看user2所有作业的结束时间，即完成时间。    3. 若系统使用Slurm调度，可运行slurmdb_dump -u user2 | grep COMPLETED，从Slurm数据库转储中筛选user2的已完成作业及完成时间。    4. 通过日志文件查询，如grep -i user2 /var/log/slurm/slurmctld.log | grep COMPLETED，从日志中查找user2作业的完成记录。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about identifying the node with minimum latency or delay, which falls under graph algorithms and distributed systems. The algorithm described computes a score for each node based on its average distance to all other nodes, then selects the one with the smallest average as the center., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the lowest network delay among nodes, and the retrieval contexts provided include two types: one with verdict 'yes' indicating a node that might be relevant to low latency or high performance (node1), and another with verdict 'no' which does not directly address the query. However, the 'yes' context provides specific information about node characteristics related to network performance, while the 'no' contexts are either irrelevant or less directly related., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant to the input question because it does not mention anything about network nodes or latency., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 当前系统中网络延迟最低的节点是哪台？
  - actual output: 根据提供的测试数据，可以确定当前系统中网络延迟最低的节点是cn[2987-2988]。1. 测试节点为cn[2987-2988]，这是在TH-3F系统网络速度测试中使用的节点，测试了不同mpi版本（mpi-x、mpi-x + tcp、mpi-n）的延时和带宽。2. 在测试结果中，mpi-x在大部分情况下表现最佳，而mpi-n延时较高，这表明使用mpi-x的节点具有更低的网络延迟。3. 测试数据显示，在所有数据大小下，mpi-x的延迟均低于mpi-x + tcp和mpi-n，因此可以推断cn[2987-2988]节点的网络延迟最低。
 
  - expected output: TH-3F系统使用osu-5.8程序对cn[2987-2988]节点进行了网络延迟测试。在不同数据大小下，mpi-x版本的延迟表现最佳，例如数据大小为0时，mpi-x的延迟为4.53微秒，远低于mpi-x + tcp的16.42微秒和mpi-n的28.08微秒；数据大小为1时，mpi-x延迟4.4微秒，同样优于其他版本。这表明在测试条件下，cn[2987-2988]节点中使用mpi-x版本时网络延迟最低。根据经验，若要确定系统中网络延迟最低的节点，可通过以下操作进一步验证：    1. 执行ping -c 10 <节点IP>命令，获取节点间的网络往返延迟，数值越小表示延迟越低。    2. 使用osu_latency工具（类似文件中的测试方法），在系统各节点间进行延迟测试，直接比较不同节点的延迟数据。    3. 通过ethtool -S <网络接口>查看网络接口的统计信息，分析数据包传输的延迟情况。    4. 利用tracepath <节点IP>命令，追踪数据包路由路径，获取各跳的延迟信息，从而确定延迟最低的节点。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['TH-3F系统网络速度测试使用osu-5.8程序进行，基于gcc9.3.0编译，测试了不同mpi版本（mpi-x、mpi-x +

控制线程数量，禁用自动创建。Node Affinity 功能允许将 MDS 线程绑定到特定 CPU 分区（CPT），提升缓存效率和内存局部性。此外，可配置 `mds_num_cpts`、`mds_rdpg_num_cpts` 和 `mds_attr_num_cpts` 来指定线程绑定的 CPT 范围。LNet 参数如 `tx_buffer_size`、`rx_buffer_size` 和 `enable_irq_affinity` 可调整网络性能，而 `credits` 参数影响网络通信的信用值，以适应不同网络环境。路由器缓存区功能则通过分配不同大小的缓冲区来优化消息转发。这些功能为系统调优提供了更多控制选项。',

  - actual output: 磁盘出现“received cancel for unknown lock cookie”报错，具体原因和解决方案如下：1. 该错误通常与Lustre文件系统相关，可能由于网络配置或磁盘缓存问题引起。当磁盘缓存未正确提交数据时，可能导致数据丢失或恢复失败。2. 故障切换时若共享存储不一致，也会引发此错误。需要确保用于故障切换的共享存储是缓存一致的，以避免此类问题。3. 如果错误发生在故障转移期间，应检查磁盘缓存设置；如果发生在未进行故障切换的重启后，需尝试让磁盘写入成功，并排查设备损坏或磁盘错误。4. 此外，某些情况下可能是由于磁盘设备在数据写入前就声称有数据写入，若磁盘设备故障或断电导致缓存丢失，可能引发此错误，此时应在重新启动Lustre文件系统前运行e2fsck检查磁盘。5. 对于多客户端使用O_APPEND写入文件的情况，可能存在锁竞争和性能问题，建议避免此类操作以减少错误发生。6. 若错误信息中提到“received cancel for unknown lock cookie”，可能涉及Lustre客户端与服务器之间的通信问题，需检查网络连接和配置是否正常。7. 在某些情况下，可能需要联系磁盘供应商进一步探讨错误原因，特别是当错误与硬件相关时。8. 确保SCSI队列大小设置合理，过小的队列可能影响性能并导致错误。9. 检查Lustre文件系统的内存使用情况，避免因内存不足导致的错误。10. 对于特定的Lustre版本和配置，可能需要调整内核参数或重新编译驱动程序以优化性能和稳定性。

  - expected output: 文件中提到“received cancel for unknown lock cookie”报错的原因是网络配置错误，将IP地址映射到本地主机（127.0.0.1）而非正确IP地址。但文件未给出具体解决方案。根据经验，该报错可能还与以下原因有关：    1. 锁冲突或过期：Lustre文件系统中锁机制出现问题，如客户端持有过期的锁Cookie，或不同客户端之间产生锁竞争，导致服务器收到未知锁Cookie的取消请求。    2. 网络通信异常：网络传输过程中数据丢失、延迟或数据包错误，使服务器接收到的锁Cookie信息不完整或错误，无法识别。    3. 服务器或客户端故障：服务器或客户端节点出现故障、重启或崩溃，导致锁状态信息不一致，服务器无法识别当前锁Cookie。针对以上原因，可采取以下解决方案：    1. 检查网络配置：确认IP地址映射正确，未错误指向127.0.0.1。查看相关网络配置文件（如/etc/hosts、DNS配置等），确保目标服务器的IP地址与主机名正确映射。    2. 处理锁冲突：在Lustre环境中，可使用lctl命令查看和管理锁状态。例如，通过lctl list_locks查看当前锁信息，若发现异常锁，可尝试使用lctl release_lock释放相关锁。    3. 排查网络问题：使用网络工具（如ping、traceroute等）检查网络连通性和延迟，确保网络传输正常。检查防火墙设置，确保相关端口未被阻塞，Lustre通信所需端口（如TCP 988、989等）正常开放。    4. 重启相关服务：若确认是服务器或客户端故障导致，可尝试重启Lustre相关服务（如MDS、OSS等），恢复锁状态信息。在重启前，确保已正确卸载相关文件系统，避免数据丢失。命令如systemctl restart lustre-mds（重启MDS服务）、systemctl restart lustre-oss（重启OSS服务）。    5. 检查磁盘缓存设置：若报错发生在故障转移期间，检查磁盘缓存设置是否正确，确保磁盘缓存一致性，避免因缓存问题导致锁信息丢失或错误。可参考磁盘供应商文档，调整缓存相关参数。

  - input: 已采集 CPU 指标，计算3F 集群当前的 CPU 整体利用率是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，目前没有直接提供3F集群的CPU整体利用率数据。提供的信息主要集中在GPU的使用情况，包括GPU占用率、显存使用情况以及相关命令和问题描述。1. 提供的内容中提到GPU 0的占用率高达98%，但未提及CPU的利用率；2. 文本中多次提到通过`nvidia-smi`命令查看GPU状态，但未涉及CPU指标的采集和计算；3. 虽然有提到作业调度系统和节点状态，但未给出与CPU利用率相关的具体数值或计算方法。因此，基于现有信息无法计算出3F集群当前的CPU整体利用率。

  - expected output: GPU 0的占用率高达98%，而其他GPU（1、2、3）占用率为0%，要计算3F集群的CPU整体利用率，可结合经验通过以下方式：    1.使用top命令：登录到集群的管理节点或计算节点，执行top命令，查看系统整体的CPU使用情况，其中“%Cpu(s)”行显示了CPU的总体利用率，包括用户态（us）、系统态（sy）、空闲（id）等百分比，整体利用率可通过100% - 空闲百分比得出。    2. 借助sinfo命令：在Slurm环境下，执行sinfo -o "%C %c"，其中%C表示已使用的CPU核心数，%c表示总CPU核心数，通过计算(已使用核心数/总核心数)×100%得到整体利用率。    3. 利用mpstat命令：执行mpstat -P ALL 1，获取每个CPU核心的利用率，再计算所有核心的平均利用率，从而得到集群CPU的整体利用率。    4. 通过监控平台查询：若集群部署了Prometheus、Grafana等监控系统，可在监控界面中查询3F集群过去一段时间内的CPU整体利用率指标。

For test case:

  - input: 当前Lustre文件系统中活跃的 MDS 数量是多少？
  - actual output: 根据提供的信息，当前Lustre文件系统中活跃的MDS数量无法直接确定，但可以总结以下相关要点：1. Lustre文件系统组件包括管理服务器（MGS）和一个或多个元数据服务器（MDS），每个MDS管理一个或多个元数据目标（MDT）。2. MDS可以配置为故障切换模式，当主MDS发生故障时，备份MDS可以接管服务，这表明系统可能有多个MDS实例，但具体数量取决于配置。3. 分布式命名空间环境（DNE）支持多个MDT，这意味着可能有多个MDS来管理不同的MDT，但具体数量未提及。综述：因此，提供的内容没有明确说明当前Lustre文件系统中活跃的MDS数量，但指出MDS的数量可以根据集群配置和需求进行扩展。

  - expected output: Lustre文件系统的组件包括元数据服务器（MDS），每个MDS管理一个或多个本地元数据目标（MDT），且支持多MDT扩展，如分布式命名空间环境（DNE）可支持多个MDT，除主MDT外还可添加其他MDS管理子目录树的MDT，但未明确当前活跃的MDS数量。根据经验，要获取Lustre文件系统中活跃的MDS数量，可通过以下操作：    1. 执行lctl get_param mds.*.state命令，查看所有MDS的状态，其中状态为“active”的即为活跃MDS。    2. 使用lfs df -l命令，查看文件系统的MDT信息，每个MDT对应的MDS即为活跃状态的MDS。    3. 检查MDS的配置文件（如/etc/lustre/mds/mds_name.cfg），结合系统启动日志（/var/log/messages），确认当前运行的MDS数量。    4. 通过ps -ef | grep mds命令，查看运行中的MDS进程数量，间接确定活跃MDS数量。

Lustre 文件系统并没有机制能够缓解硬件存储改隐。当服务融无法访问或终止服务时，将无法访问文件。Lustre 2.11 中引入了 Lustre 文件级元余 (FLR) 功能，任何 Lustre 文件都可将相同的数据存储在多台 OST 上，以提升系统在存储故障或其它故障发生时的稳健性。在存在多个针像的情况下，可选择最合适的镜像来啊应单个请求，这对 IO 可用性有直接影啊。此外，对于许多客户闯同时读取的文件〈如输入版，共孚库或可执行文件)，可以通过创建文件数据的多个镜像来提高单个文件的并行聚合读取性能。第一阶段的FLR 功能通过延迟写入实现〈如"图 21.1 FLR EIR GA" 所示)。在写入镜像文件时，只有一个主镜像或首选镜像在写入过程中直接更新，而其他镜像将被标记为stale。通过使用命令行工具《由用户或管理员直接运行或通过目动监控工具运行)同步各镜像之间同步，该文件可在随后再次写入其它镜像。Object j (primary, preferred)delayed resync图 25: FLR delay writting图']

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question was: "eX某账号被锁定怎么办", and the actual output provided by the model is a JSON response containing information about checking disk space, which is not related to account lockout issues. The user asked for reasons why their account might be locked out due to too many failed login attempts, but the assistant's response did not address that issue at all. Instead, it focused on technical system checks unrelated to account access problems., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.6 because there are some inconsistencies in the claim and retrieval context regarding the system name (Slurm vs. Slurm) and the specific issue with eX某账号, but not enough for a lower score., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieved node is directly relevant to the user's query. The user asked how to check for a stuck account issue, and this response provides specific steps on checking reasons for an unresponsive account., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5217391304347826, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about the user's query regarding "eX某账号" or any related topics, and instead contains unrelated statements such as "How to kill a process in Linux"., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: eX某账号大量作业卡住，如何检查原因？
  - actual output: eX某账号大量作业卡住可能由多种原因引起，需要从资源分配、系统错误、存储问题和环境配置等方面进行检查，具体包括：1. 检查资源分配情况，确保内存和核数设置合理，避免因资源不足导致作业无法提交或运行；2. 查看系统错误日志，识别与通信库或资源管理器相关的错误，如UCX错误和“Requested nodes are busy”提示；3. 检查存储配额和IO状态，确认是否存在存储空间不足或IO错误导致的作业卡顿；4. 验证编译和运行环境的一致性，避免因AVX支持不匹配或路径配置错误引发的问题；5. 确认是否有系统维护或网络延迟影响作业执行，必要时手动终止并续算作业。具体操作如下：1. 检查作业脚本中的内存限制设置，例如在yhrun命令中添加mem=100GB以限制内存使用，避免占用全部内存导致节点繁忙；2. 查看作业日志中的错误信息，如“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”和“UCX ERROR GLEX cre:”等，判断是否与内存或I/O操作有关；3. 使用lfs quota命令检查用户存储配额，确认是否超过软限制或硬限制，清理多余文件以释放空间；4. 检查编译时是否使用了-xHOST/-xAVX选项，若在计算节点上运行时CPU不支持AVX，需修改编译参数；5. 联系系统管理员确认是否有系统维护或网络问题，必要时手动终止卡住的作业并重新提交；6. 对于GPU相关问题，检查PCIe连接是否松动，确保GPU设备可被正确识别；7. 若作业因信号9被终止，可能是由于MPI版本问题或系统维护，需替换.bashrc中的编译器和MPI路径，并确认作业是否因维护被挂起。通过以上步骤可以逐步排查并解决作业卡住的问题。

  - expected output: 从其他作业卡住的案例及解决方法可推测可能原因，如节点资源不足（如“Requested nodes are busy”错误）、内存分配问题、MPI版本不兼容、UCX通信库错误、存储配额超限或IO问题等。若eX账号大量作业卡住，可按以下步骤检查原因：    1. 检查节点资源状态：执行sinfo查看集群节点的分配和空闲状态，若大量节点显示“alloc”或“drain”，可能是节点资源不足导致作业无法获取资源而卡住。    2. 查看作业队列和状态：使用yhq或squeue -u eX_account查看作业队列，若作业长时间处于“PD”（pending）状态，可能因资源不足等待调度；若处于“R”（running）但无输出更新，可能程序卡住。    3. 检查内存和CPU使用：对卡住作业所在节点执行top或htop，查看内存是否耗尽、CPU是否被高负载进程占用，若内存不足可尝试通过slurm参数限制内存使用（如mem=100GB）。    4. 分析作业日志：查看作业输出日志（如slurm-*.out），若出现“Requested nodes are busy”，可能节点被其他作业占用；若有“UCX ERROR”或MPI相关错误（如PMIX_Fence failed），可能是通信库或MPI版本问题，可尝试更换MPI版本或调整编译参数。    5. 检查存储配额和IO：执行lfs quota -g eX_account /vol-th查看存储使用情况，若超过软限制（500G）或硬限制（1T），需清理数据；若日志出现“no space left on device”，可能OST满载，需联系管理员检查存储状态。    6. 排查程序本身问题：若作业运行中卡住且无错误日志，可能程序逻辑问题（如死循环），可通过gdbattach进程查看堆栈，或尝试减少核数、调整程序参数（如设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1）重新提交.通过以上步骤逐步排查，可定位eX账号作业卡住的具体原因并针对性解决。例如，若确认是节点资源不足，可等待资源释放或申请更高优先级队列；若为存储配额问题，清理数据后即可恢复作业运行。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about checking reasons for Elasticsearch cluster startup failure, but the assistant's response does not address how to check or diagnose the issue. It only provides a general explanation of what an ESClient is and its purpose in connecting to Elasticsearch clusters without addressing the specific problem of troubleshooting startup failures., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is lower than expected because there might be a typo or discrepancy between the specified line number and the actual one., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any relevant information related to checking the cause of ESXi cluster node failure. The first context has some technical error but it is unrelated to the query which asks specifically about checking reasons for user login issues, while the second one explicitly states that it does not address login problems., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about how to check or debug ESXi cluster configuration issues, so it cannot provide guidance on that topic., error: None)

UCX错误日志指向glex_md.c文件的362行，表明在注册用户缓冲区时发生问题，这可能与通信库相关。3. 最终任务被中止并显示“Aborted”和“STEP 3596459. ON cn1944 CANCELLED AT”，表明作业执行失败，可能与资源管理器或集群配置有关。

  - expected output: 系统运行中出现“ERROR failed to register user buffer datatype”错误，涉及地址和长度信息，可能与内存或I/O操作有关，随后有多个指向glex_md.c文件362行的UCX错误日志，表明注册用户缓冲区时出现问题，最后任务中止，显示作业执行失败，可能与通信库或资源管理器相关。从这些信息来看，ES集群用户统一资源接口服务启动失败，可从以下方面检查原因。    1. 检查内存资源状态：使用free -h命令查看系统内存占用情况，确认是否存在内存不足导致用户缓冲区注册失败的情况。若内存使用率过高，可通过关闭无关进程释放资源，或检查是否有内存泄漏问题。    2. 排查 I/O 操作异常：执行df -h查看存储设备挂载及空间使用情况，确认是否有磁盘空间不足或文件系统错误。运行dmesg | grep -i error或dmesg | grep disk命令，检查磁盘 I/O 错误日志，判断是否存在磁盘硬件故障或读写异常。    3. 检查通信库与 UCX 组件：查看 UCX 相关日志（如文档中提到的 glex_md.c:362 错误），确认通信库是否存在版本不兼容或配置错误。尝试重新安装或更新 UCX 通信库，命令参考：yum install ucx -y，并检查库文件路径是否正确。    4. 排查资源管理器与作业调度：查看 Slurm 或相关资源管理器日志，确认是否存在作业调度异常或进程管理错误。检查是否有未释放的资源锁或僵死进程，可通过ps -ef | grep slurm或kill -9 <进程ID>清理异常进程。    5. 检查 Lustre 存储状态：若涉及 Lustre 存储，按文档步骤挂起对应分区作业：通过运维平台找到对应存储分区（如 mds1 对应 THL6），执行 “作业操作” 中的挂起操作。ssh mds1登录存储节点，通过cat /var/log/messages | grep -i mds1命令查看日志是否有-30或scsi cmnd错误，若无则通过systemctl restart lustre-mds命令重启 mds 节点。    6. 系统综合日志排查：查看系统全局错误日志/var/log/messages或/var/log/syslog，搜索与服务启动相关的报错信息（如 “user buffer datatype”），定位具体模块故障。检查服务启动脚本是否存在权限不足或路径错误，可通过systemctl status es-service查看服务启动日志。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about reasons for a low relevance score between an input prompt and an AI response, but I don't have enough context or specific criteria to determine the exact reason., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieved context by stating that the task execution issues are caused by a specific reason (process engine failures) which isn't mentioned in the context. The context doesn't provide any information on this, so it cannot be confirmed., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval result has a high contextual precision score of 1.0, indicating that all retrieved nodes are relevant to the user's query. The first node provides direct advice on resolving task interruption issues by checking job submission methods and environment variables, which directly addresses the problem described in the query about 'task running interrupted'. However, the second node has a verdict of 'no' because it does not relate to the issue at all; it discusses unrelated topics like Nobel Prizes and Albert Einstein. The user's query is about task interruption during execution, so nodes that do not address this specific technical problem are irrelevant., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5294117647058824, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Albert Einstein's birthplace or nationality, and while it mentions his work on relativity and photoelectric effect, it doesn't provide specific details relevant to these topics., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 存在任务运行时中断的问题，请检查原因。
  - actual output: 存在任务运行时中断的问题，需要从多个方面进行检查和分析，具体原因包括但不限于以下几点：1. 系统可能因进程引擎故障导致作业被信号9终止，这通常与MPI版本有关，建议替换~/.bashrc中关于intel编译器和MPI的路径；2. 作业可能因系统维护被挂起，此时会显示“yhrun: got SIGCONT”的提示，需手动终止并续算；3. 程序编译与运行环境不一致可能导致AVX支持错误，例如在编译时使用了-xHOST或-xAVX选项，而运行时的硬件不支持AVX，应移除这些选项；4. 存储配额问题也可能导致任务中断，例如磁盘配额超限或IO错误，需清理数据或联系管理员；5. 节点划分问题可能导致任务无法正常运行，如无法将11个节点划分为10个部分，这可能与通信器无效有关；6. GPU无法识别可能由于PCIe连接松动，需检查硬件连接；7. 文件系统问题如OST满载或存储恢复期间可能导致IO错误，需等待或联系工程师处理；8. 任务可能因节点负载高、网络延迟或存储压力而出现卡顿或中断，需优化作业提交脚本并确保环境变量正确导出。

  - expected output: 任务运行时中断可能由多种原因导致。例如，EX系统CESM2.1.3在无报错情况下中断，可正常断点续算，建议使用特定脚本提交作业；进程引擎故障导致作业被信号9终止，可能是MPI版本问题，需替换.bashrc中的编译器和MPI路径；作业可能因系统维护被挂起，需手动终止并续算；程序编译与运行环境不一致，如AVX支持错误，应移除-xHOST/-xAVX选项；存储配额超限会导致无法写入，IO错误可能由存储压力或OST满载引起；ls命令卡顿可能因节点负载高、网络延迟或存储恢复；GPU无法识别可能因PCIe连接松动；还有无法将节点合理划分、MPI_Topo_test函数调用失败等问题导致任务中断。综合来看，任务运行时中断可从多方面检查原因。    1. 检查作业提交方式，若使用EX系统CESM2.1.3，可尝试使用指定脚本提交，脚本内容为：#!/bin/bash # SBATCH -p cp6 # SBATCH -N 10 # SBATCH -n 560 export GLEX_USE_ZC_RNDV=0 ./case.submit。    2. 排查MPI版本及相关配置，若出现进程引擎故障、被信号9终止的情况，用/vol6/source.sh中的内容替换原~/.bashrc中关于intel编译器、mpi的路径。接着，关注系统维护情况，若作业运行中输出slurm文件出现yhrun: got SIGCONT，说明作业被挂起，可手动杀掉作业并从断点续算。    3. 检查程序编译与运行环境的一致性，若报错提示不支持AVX，编译时去掉-xHOST/-xAVX选项。再检查存储相关问题，查看存储配额是否超限，lfs quota –g username /vol-th命令查看，若超限则清理数据；若提示IO错误或无空间，可能是存储压力大或某一OST已满，可重新提交作业或联系工程师。对于ls命令卡顿，可等待后重试。若GPU无法识别，提交作业时可尝试相关解决方法。    4. 检查节点划分和MPI通信器问题，确保节点数量能合理划分，避免出现无效通信器错误。通过以上步骤逐步排查，可定位任务运行时中断的原因。

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not directly address the user's question about 'the reasons for the low score' and instead focuses solely on correcting a grammatical error. It fails to provide any substantive analysis or explanation related to the task, which is to explain why the score is 0.5 based on irrelevant statements., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0 because there are several contradictions between the claim and the retrieved context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking for the cause of a specific error in computational chemistry simulations. The retrieval contexts provided are relevant as they address similar technical problems: one discusses NaN (Not a Number) errors due to coordinate issues or parameter errors, and another mentions normalizing data to handle large values. However, the first context does not directly mention GROMACS but refers to GROMACS which is likely a typo for GROMACS, and it provides advice on potential energy calculations in molecular dynamics simulations. The second context talks about normalization of data when dealing with very large numbers, which can prevent numerical instability that might lead to NaNs. Both contexts are relevant as they deal with computational simulation errors related to numerical issues or configuration problems., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 任务运行出现NaN，原因是什么？
  - actual output: 任务执行过程中出现NaN值，可能由以下因素引起：1. 数据数值过大可能导致计算异常，例如在NCL画图时因数据数值过大导致速度过慢，通过将数据除以10^27后问题得到解决，这表明大数据处理时需要适当归一化；2. 初始结构未平衡或参数错误也可能导致能量值非有限，如HPC4及3K运行deepmd-gromacs时出现的报错“Step 0: The total potential energy is -nan”，提示坐标值过大、初始结构未平衡或参数错误；3. 环境变量设置冲突也可能引发问题，例如在运行deepmd-gromacs时，设置环境变量GMX_DEEPPD_INPUT_JSON可能导致潜在冲突，取消该设置可解决问题。
 
  - expected output: 任务运行出现NaN可能由多种原因导致。在HPC4及3K运行deepmd-gromacs时，报错显示总势能为-nan，可能是坐标值过大、初始结构未平衡或参数错误引起，解决方法为取消环境变量GMX_DEEPMD_INPUT_JSON的设置；另外，数据数值过大也可能引发类似问题，如NCL画图速度过慢，将数据除以10^27后问题得到解决。综合来看，任务运行出现NaN可从以下方面检查原因。    1. 检查初始结构和参数配置，查看坐标值是否存在异常过大的情况，确认初始结构是否平衡，同时检查拓扑文件中的相互作用参数是否正确，这有助于排除因结构或参数问题导致的NaN现象。    2. 排查环境变量设置，若使用deepmd-gromacs，可执行unset GMX_DEEPMD_INPUT_JSON命令取消相关环境变量，避免其引发潜在冲突。    3. 关注数据本身的数值大小，若数据数值过大，可对数据进行归一化处理，例如将数据除以适当的倍数（如10的幂次方），以解决因数据数值异常导致的问题。

The actual output provided does not contain any information related to this issue, so it cannot be determined whether the answer is correct or incorrect., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is lower because there might be other factors affecting the output quality., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about troubleshooting a specific error when using the `yp_run` command with an account named 'hpc2019' on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one positive and one negative. The positive node mentions that yhrun is part of PBS Professional software used in HPC environments, specifically for job scheduling and execution management. It also states that the error 'communication connection failure' typically occurs due to network issues or configuration problems between the scheduler host and compute nodes. This aligns with the user's issue about communication failures during job submission on a cluster system.

The negative node does not provide any specific information related to the query, so it is less relevant for troubleshooting this particular error message.

Therefore, the retrieval contexts are ranked by relevance: first the positive node (rank 1) and then the negative one (rank 2). The score of 1.0 indicates that the most relevant context is the positive one, which directly addresses the issue in a way that matches the user's problem., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47058823529411764, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about HPC cloud accounts or troubleshooting VPN configuration issues related to yhrun commands., error: None)

  - input: hpc云 ypz2019 账号，使用 yhrun 命令提交 hostname 命令，提示 communication connection failure，如何排查原因？
  - actual output: 通信连接失败可能由多种原因引起，根据提供的内容，可以排查以下几点：1. 检查网络连接和节点状态，确保计算节点与管理节点之间的通信正常，如果存在节点问题，可以使用-x参数剔除问题节点，并联系管理员处理。2. 检查时间同步问题，如果计算节点的时间未与管理节点同步，可能导致通信失败，需要联系管理员进行时间同步。3. 检查环境变量和动态库配置，确保所需的动态库路径已正确设置，可以通过编辑~/.bashrc文件添加LD_LIBRARY_PATH环境变量来解决。4. 确保使用的命令和脚本正确，例如使用yhbatch提交作业比yhrun更稳定，避免因终端关闭或脚本终止导致任务被杀掉。5. 检查是否有残留进程或节点错误，如发现节点有报错信息，如clocksource错误，应将节点drain掉并告知用户在提交时剔除该节点。6. 如果是由于权限问题导致的通信失败，需检查队列和资源限制，确保用户有权限使用指定的队列和资源。7. 检查是否缺少必要的证书文件，如ca.crt文件，若缺少则需将其复制到指定路径。8. 确认作业提交的资源申请是否合理，确保yhbatch申请的资源不小于yhrun需求的资源。9. 查看系统日志以获取更多关于通信失败的具体信息，帮助定位问题根源。10. 如果以上方法均无法解决问题，建议联系系统管理员进一步排查。

  - expected output: 使用yhrun命令提交hostname命令提示communication connection failure，可能与网络连接、节点时间不同步、MPI运行错误或节点问题有关。例如，作业断开时slurm日志出现“Job credential expired”是计算结点时间未与管理结点同步，可加-x剔除问题结点并联系管理员；MPI运行错误如“progress engine failure”可能由网络或节点问题引起，需联系管理员处理。综合来看，可从以下方面排查原因。    1. 检查网络连接是否正常，确保VPN连接稳定，若连接时报错缺少ca.crt文件，将其拷贝到指定路径（如用户名\OpenVPN\config\相关配置路径）。    2. 查看slurm日志，若出现时间同步相关报错，使用date命令查看计算节点和管理节点时间，若不同步，提交作业时加-x剔除问题结点并联系管理员同步时间。    3. 若日志提示MPI相关错误，如“progress engine failure”，可能是网络或节点故障，联系管理员检查处理。    4. 检查作业提交方式，建议使用yhbatch替代yhrun提交作业，避免因终端关闭等导致任务异常。通过以上步骤逐步排查，可定位并解决通信连接失败问题。

For test case:

  - input: 如何解决ex系统任务读写带宽占用过高挂起问题？
  - actual output: 针对ex系统任务读写带宽占用过高导致挂起的问题，可以从以下几个方面进行解决：1. 检查存储配额和IO状态，确保没有超过磁盘配额限制，同时确认存储系统是否处于正常运行状态，避免因存储压力或OST满载导致的IO错误；2. 优化作业脚本配置，例如在yhrun命令中添加mem=100GB限制内存使用，减少资源占用，或者调整作业核数以降低对系统带宽的需求；3. 检查程序编译与运行环境的一致性，避免因AVX支持错误导致的进程异常终止，必要时移除-xHOST/-xAVX选项；4. 如果作业因系统维护被挂起，需手动终止并续算，同时关注系统维护通知，合理安排作业提交时间；5. 对于GPU无法识别的问题，检查PCIe连接是否松动，确保硬件连接稳定；6. 在代码中设置适当的环境变量，如CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES，避免因CUDA设备未检测到导致的错误；7. 若使用ls命令时出现卡顿，可能是节点负载高、网络延迟或存储恢复所致，可尝试等待一段时间后重试。通过以上措施，可以有效缓解ex系统任务读写带宽占用过高带来的挂起问题。

  - expected output: TH-3F系统运行calypso.x和vasp时因节点资源不足或内存分配不当出现作业无法提交的情况，解决方法包括调整核数、限制内存使用等；ES系统JUPYTER报错内存占用过高，可通过设置环境变量解决；此外，存储配额超限、IO错误等也可能引发类似问题。具体解决步骤如下：    1. 调整作业资源配置：减少作业使用的核数，如将vasp作业核数从64改为56，避免因核数过多导致资源占用过高。在yhrun命令中添加内存限制参数，如mem=100GB，限制作业使用的内存量，可根据实际情况调整数值。    2. 优化程序运行方式：使用mpi-n编译的vasp，并通过mpirun调用，这种方式可能在一定程度上降低资源占用，虽然计算速度可能略慢，但能解决因编译方式导致的问题。    3. 设置程序参数：在vasp运行时，设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1，优化计算过程中的参数配置，提高资源利用效率，减少带宽占用。    4. 处理内存相关问题：若遇到TensorFlow分配内存超过系统可用内存10%的情况，将CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES设为0或注释掉这行，也可在代码开头添加os.environ['TF_XLA_FLAGS'] = 'tf_xla_enable_xla_devices'，解决内存占用过高的问题。    5. 检查存储情况：使用lfs quota –g username /vol-th命令查看账号存储配额，若存储使用超过软限制500G或硬限制1T，清理数据至限额以下，避免因存储问题影响读写。    6. 处理IO错误：若作业运行提示“forrtl: Input/output error”，可能是存储压力大导致，可重新提交作业；若提示“forrtl: No space left on device”，可能是某一OST存储已满，联系工程师或系统管理员处理。通过以上步骤对作业资源配置、程序运行方式、内存使用及存储情况等方面进行调整和优化，可有效解决EX系统任务读写带宽占用过高导致的挂起问题。在操作过程中，需根据实际情况灵活调整参数和设置，并及时与相关技术人员沟通处理存储等方面的问题。

  - actual output: 用户通过脚本提交多个多节点 MPI 作业时，首个作业正常完成，后续作业运行结束后卡住并因 PMIx 集体操作超时被取消，报错信息显示与pmixp_coll_ring超时相关，可能的故障原因及优化方案如下：1. 故障原因分析：可能与多作业并发执行时的资源竞争或通信机制有关，尤其是在多个作业同时运行时，PMIx库在处理集体操作时可能出现超时问题；此外，MPI通信协议中的某些设置可能导致节点内和节点间的通信交织，影响性能，进而引发超时；另外，作业提交脚本可能存在设计缺陷，导致后续作业未能正确释放资源或等待前序作业完成，从而引发阻塞。2. 优化方案建议：调整MPI通信参数，例如尝试修改UCX_TLS参数，将原设置sm,glex改为glex，以避免节点内与节点间通信的交织，提升通信效率；优化作业提交脚本，确保每个作业在启动前等待前一个作业完全结束，避免资源竞争；检查并调整PMIx库的配置，增加超时阈值或优化集体操作的处理逻辑，以适应多作业并发执行的需求；对系统环境进行测试，确认是否存在特定组合（如特定编译器和MPI实现）导致的问题，并根据测试结果选择更稳定的环境配置；最后，监控作业运行状态，及时发现并处理异常情况，防止作业因超时被取消。

  - expected output: 用户通过脚本提交多个多节点MPI作业时，首个作业正常完成，后续作业运行结束后卡住，因PMIx集体操作超时被取消，报错与pmixpcollring超时相关。类似问题在3M系统中出现过，脚本内提交多个多节点作业时，仅首个作业正常完成，其余作业运行完成后卡在结束位置，报错显示pmixpcollring集体操作超时，如“collective timeout seq=1”，且作业状态为S，持续一段时间后被cancel。此外，jorek程序测试中发现mpigather耗时异常，调整UCXTLS参数（将sm,glex改为glex）后问题解决，推测sm通信可能导致节点内与节点间通信交织影响性能。故障原因分析：    资源竞争与通信冲突：多个多节点MPI作业并发执行时，可能争夺网络资源或PMIx通信通道，导致后续作业的集体操作（如ring算法）因资源不足或调度混乱而超时。首个作业优先获取资源正常完成，后续作业因资源被占用或通信链路拥堵，无法及时完成集体操作。    UCXTLS参数配置不当：若作业使用的UCXTLS参数包含sm（共享内存），可能在多节点多进程场景下，节点内通信与节点间通信交织，影响MPI集体操作效率，导致超时。如jorek案例中，sm通信使节点内和节点间通讯冲突，改为glex后性能恢复。    PMIx库或MPI实现问题：PMIx集体操作的ring算法在多作业场景下可能存在缺陷，如状态管理异常、超时机制不合理，导致后续作业的ring操作无法正常完成，触发超时取消。    作业提交脚本逻辑问题：脚本提交多个作业时，若没有合理的间隔或资源预留机制，可能导致后续作业在启动时资源（如网络连接数、PMIx上下文）未正确释放或初始化，引发集体操作超时。优化方案：    调整UCXTLS参数：尝试修改UCXTLS参数，避免使用sm或调整参数顺序，如将UCX_TLS=sm,glex改为UCX_TLS=glex，减少节点内与节点间通信冲突。可在作业脚本中添加export UCX_TLS=glex。    增加作业提交间隔：在脚本中设置提交间隔，避免连续提交作业导致资源竞争。例如，使用sleep 5在每次提交作业后等待5秒。    检查PMIx相关环境变量：确认PMIx相关环境变量配置正确，如PMIX_TIMEOUT可适当增大，设置export PMIX_TIMEOUT=300（单位秒，根据实际情况调整）。    使用作业依赖或队列机制：通过作业调度系统的依赖功能，确保后续作业在前一个作业完成后提交，避免并发冲突。例如，使用SLURM的--dependency=afterok:JOBID参数。    更新MPI库或PMIx版本：若当前MPI库或PMIx版本存在已知bug，尝试升级到最新稳定版本，修复集体操作中的潜在问题。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about troubleshooting a specific error message related to an 'EX system' and the term 'user operation'. The assistant provided a detailed explanation of what EX systems are, their components, and general advice on checking connections. However, it did not address the specific error code or provide any steps to resolve the issue. While some technical details about network cables were mentioned, they are too vague and do not directly relate to 'EX system user operation'. The response is missing key information needed to answer the question accurately., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output did not align well with the user's query regarding the cause of the error. The retrieval context provided indicates that the issue is related to an error in accessing a packed struct member, possibly due to alignment problems, but the claim incorrectly attributes it to memory or I/O operation issues., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the causes and solutions for errors encountered when using a system called EX系统用户作业报. The retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' which directly addresses the query, but also includes irrelevant nodes that do not relate to the specific error mentioned by the user. However, there are two other nodes: node 1 has verdict 'no', and node 2 has verdict 'yes'. But note that the score is given as 1.00 for contextual precision, which indicates a high level of relevance. The user's query seems to be about troubleshooting an error in EX system user job reporting or something similar. The retrieval contexts are not provided here, so I cannot analyze them directly., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4782608695652174, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about UCX errors or system errors, and instead focuses on Albert Einstein's biography., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: EX系统用户作业报 UCX ERROR 错误的原因和解决方法是什么？
  - actual output: 系统出现UCX ERROR错误的原因主要包括三个方面：一是注册用户缓冲区时发生问题，可能与内存或I/O操作有关，错误信息涉及地址和长度信息，且在glex_md.c文件的362行出现多次；二是UCX编译过程中因packed结构体成员取地址导致未对齐指针的问题，错误信息显示在glex_channel.c中，由于结构体对齐问题引发警告并被当作错误处理；三是系统在尝试创建GLEX区域时因内存资源不足而失败，错误信息为“GLEX create region failed: no enough memory resources”，表明存在内存分配或资源管理相关的问题。1. 注册用户缓冲区时发生问题的原因可能与内存或I/O操作有关，错误信息涉及地址和长度信息，且在glex_md.c文件的362行出现多次，这可能导致任务被中止，显示“Aborted”和“STEP 3596459. ON cn1944 CANCELLED AT”，表明作业执行失败，可能与通信库或资源管理器相关。2. UCX编译报错的原因是packed结构体成员取地址导致未对齐指针的问题，错误信息显示在glex_channel.c中，由于结构体对齐问题引发警告并被当作错误处理，解决方法是在configure后删除src/uct/glex/Makefile中的-Werror选项。3. 内存资源不足导致GLEX区域创建失败的原因是系统在尝试创建GLEX区域时无法分配足够的内存资源，错误信息为“GLEX create region failed: no enough memory resources”，该错误在同一个节点cn1024:2865294:0上重复发生，可能与内存分配或资源管理相关的问题有关。

  - expected output: EX系统用户作业报UCX ERROR错误的原因主要有以下几点：一是注册用户缓冲区数据类型时出现输入/输出错误，可能与内存或I/O操作有关；二是UCX编译时因结构体对齐问题报错，如对packed结构体成员取地址导致未对齐指针，这是由于编译时启用了-Werror选项，将警告当作错误处理；三是创建GLEX区域时内存资源不足，多次出现“no enough memory resources”的错误提示。针对这些问题，可按以下步骤解决：    1. 检查内存资源：当出现“GLEX create region failed: no enough memory resources”错误时，先使用free -h命令查看系统内存使用情况，确认是否有足够的内存资源。若内存不足，可关闭其他不必要的进程释放内存，或调整作业申请的内存量，在yhrun命令中添加mem=XXGB参数限制内存使用。    2. 处理编译报错：若UCX编译时因结构体对齐问题报错，可在configure后，编辑ucx目录下src/uct/glex/Makefile文件，删除其中的-Werror选项。    3. 排查I/O和缓冲区问题：对于注册用户缓冲区数据类型时的I/O错误，使用dmesg | grep disk命令检查磁盘I/O错误日志，查看是否有磁盘故障或读写异常。同时，检查相关文件系统的状态，如Lustre存储是否正常，可参考之前的Lustre存储故障处理步骤，挂起对应分区作业、查询日志并重启相关节点。    4. 更新UCX版本或配置：若上述方法无效，可尝试更新UCX到最新版本，或检查UCX的配置参数是否正确。例如，确认UCXTLS环境变量的设置是否合适，可设置为*export UCXTLS=sm,tcp,glex以启用多种传输层。

For test case:

  - input: 如何查看TH-eX的系统任务信息？
  - actual output: 查看TH-eX的系统任务信息可以通过以下几种方式实现：1. 使用命令yhq查看作业状态，用户可以根据自己的作业情况填入jobid来查看详细信息，如果作业长时间处于CG状态，表示未正常退出，系统管理员会定期处理；如果变为$状态，表示系统维护中，完成后恢复。2. 使用yhinfo或yhi命令查看节点状态，可以了解节点的使用情况，包括分区、可用状态、任务最长运行时间限制和节点数量等信息。3. 使用yhbatch提交批处理作业时，可以通过查看生成的slurm开头的.out文件获取作业的输出信息，同时在提交脚本中可以使用yhrun命令加载计算作业，此时yhrun通过环境变量感知已经分配了资源，从而直接创建作业而不再次提交作业。4. 用户还可以通过查看磁盘配额信息来了解存储和文件数量的限制，使用命令jlfs quota -g groupname /fs2或lf quota -u username /fs2来查看配额信息。5. 如果需要更详细的帮助信息，可以通过响应命令后加入--help的方式获取，或者查阅SLURM相关资料。6. 遇到问题时，可以联系技术支持团队，他们会在24小时内给予回复。

  - expected output: 用户可使用yhq命令查看自己提交的作业，还能通过yhinfo或yhi命令查看结点使用情况，使用yhcancel命令取消任务，且作业有不同状态及对应的含义。具体查看方法如下：    1. 查看作业状态：使用yhq命令可查看自己提交的作业，若要查看作业明细，可通过yhq jobid命令，其中jobid为作业的记号。    2. 查看结点状态：yhinfo或yhi为查看结点使用情况的命令，使用yhi -l可获得结点更为详细的信息。    3. 查看分区信息：使用yhcontrol show partition partition_name可查看相应分区的详细信息，使用yhacctmgr list association可查看自己账号的权限设置。    4. 查看磁盘配额：使用lfs quota -g groupname /fs2或lfs quota -u username /fs2查看配额信息。

TH-eX 系统用户手册业，用户可以在脚本中提交多个任务，逐个计算。如前所述，系统中作业的运行分成两步:资源分配与任务加载。批处理作业使用 yhbatch 提交脚本的方式运行，yhbatch 负责资源分配，yhbatch 获取资源后，会在获取资源的第一个结点运行提交的脚本。3.3.1.1 MPI 并行作业举例一:假设用户可执行文件为 aout，需使用 112 个进程并行计算，编写提交脚本sub.sh 如下:使用批处理命令进行作业提交:计算过程中，脚本所在的工作目录中默认会生成以 slurm 开头的.out SCF, DF幕输出的信息会保存到该文件中。注意:yhbatch 申请的资源应当不小于 sub.sh 脚本中 yhrun 申请的资源。3.3.1.2 OpenMP 并行作业OpenMP 文持共享式内存并行，因此单纯的 OpenMP 多线程并行程序只能在单计算结点上运行。由于每个计算结点是 56 个处理器核心数，因此最大线程数设置不能超过 56.如果用户的程序文持该并行方式，知用户可执行文件为aout，需使用 56 个OpenMP 多线程并行计算。编写提交脚本 sub.sh 如下:\n*REIZate TH-eX 系统用户手册提交批处理命令如下:3.3.1.3 MPI+', '不需要交互，则需使用批处理作业提交方式。3. yhrun 提交的任务，如果没有进行输入输出的重定向，在关闭登陆客户端软件时，会导致任务中断，因此如无特殊需要，在直接使用 yhrun 提交任务时，重定向输入输出，并保留相应的 log 文件，方便遇到问题时，技术人员及时解决。重定向举例如下:>为重定癌符号，2>人1 表示标准错误输出重定癌至标准输出，最后的信表示后台提区方式，这样保证了该任务在登陆客户端关闭时依然保持不中断。4. 再次提示，如无特殊需要请使用批处理作业 yhbatch 提交方式，yhbatch 提交的作业终端关闭后不会受到影响。3.3.3 应用软件作业提交举例3.3.3.1 应用软件 LAMMPS 使用1) 在登陆节点命令行下加载 LAMMPS 所需环境变量:31\n*[了te TH-eX 系统用户手册说明:从 lammps 的版本名称 lammps/24Mar22-icc19.0-mpich-x 可以看出:> 它的版本号是 24Mar22，即 2022-03-24 发布的版本。用户可以依据需求更换其他版本。> ‘EATER ana Intel 19.0.4 和 mpich-x ，相关的 module 环境已被 lammps 模块自动加载。2) 编写任务脚本 sub.sh 如下:> 第一行: 它是一个用/bin/sh 来解析的脚本文件。> FAT: -N 2 表示 2 个节点; -mn112 Ratt 112 cpu 核， Imp_ mpi 是可执行程序的名字;in.test 是输入文件名。kasatat于=pA>oy|pa+aywR3.3.3.2 应用软件 GROMACS 使用1) 在登陆节点命令行下加载 GROMACS 所需环境变量:2) 编写任务脚本 sub.sh 如下:说明:> ”第二行: 用 gmx mpi grompp 进行前期处理。> B=: 用 gmx mpi mdrun 来计算，-ntomp 1 表示每个 mpi 进程局用一个 openmp 线程。> “用户根据自己的需求将相关的 gmx 处理命令写入 sub.sh 脚本即可。\n*REXESrr', '方式，知用户可执行文件为aout，需使用 56 个OpenMP 多线程并行计算。编写提交脚本 sub.sh 如下:\n*REIZate TH-eX 系统用户手册提交批处理命令如下:3.3.1.3 MPI+OpenMP 并行作业如果用户的程序文持该并行方式，各用户可执行文件为aout，需使用 14 个进程并行计算，每个进程下开启 8 个 OpenMP 线程，则应使用的计算结点数为14*8/56=2. 2m Herc HAAS sub.sh 如下:加载环境变量，并提交批处理命令:注意: TH-EX 系统上的资源使用抢占式调度方式，即作业在结点上哪怕内运行了一个核的进程，其他作业也无法再分配到该结点上。特别提示:批处理作业提交模式，使用范围很广，由于手册篇幅限制，不能详述，如果您在提交批处理作业的过程中遇到了任何问题，请联系中心技术人员。3.3.2 交互式作业提交 yhrun对于交互式作业，资源分配与任务加载两步均通过 yhrun 命令进行: 当在登录 shell 中执行 yhrun 命令时，yhzrun 首先向系统提交作业请求并等待资源分配，然后在所分配的结点上加载作业任务。yhrun 运行的主要格式如下:yhrun [options] program\nNSz TH-eX 系统用户手册yhrun 包括多个选项，与 yhbatch 类似。示例:1) 在分区 ep4，使用两个结点上运行 hostname$ yhrun -N 2 -n 112 -p cp4 hostnameyhrun: job 4385 queued and waiting for resourcesyhrun: job 4385 has been allocated resourcescn4cn4cn5特别注意:1. yhrun 基本可以蔡代 mpirun，使用 1.3.2 章节推荐的系统自带的 mpi SES译的程序，完全可以使用 ynhrun 提交任务，而不需使用 mpirun.2. yhrun 为交互式作业提交方式，用户如需要和程序进行交互，则选择直接使用 yhrun 提交任务，如果不需要交互，则需使用批处理作业提交方式。3. yhrun 提交的任务，如果没有进行输入输出的重定向，在关闭登陆客户端软件时，会导致任务中断，因此如无特殊需要，在直接使用', "用户登录后会出现如图 3-1 的磁盘配额信息:Filesystem used quota Limit grace files quota kimt = grace/fs2 3616 045126 1T - 13942 1999966 2000000图 3-1 磁盘配额登陆提示信息22\nPr TH-eX 系统用户手册表 3-2 磁盘配额各关键词说明5 ee >| Rhesystem |用户所在的共享分布式存储it | rEpiles |用疡已有的文伯数量 (单位: 个)it | 文件数量硬限制 〈单位: 个)以磁盘存储为例说明软、硬限制的含义，文件数软、硬限制的含义与其一样。用户使用存储低于 512G 时，如图 3-1 所示，存储状态正常，当用户使用存储介于512G 和 1T 之间时，存储状态如图 3-2 所示，kbytes 参数对应的数字带有“*”表示用户配额异营，“6d23h59m57Ss”表示一个月的倒计时，如果用户在倒计时结束前将使用存储清理到 512G 以下，则存储状态恢复正常。和否则用户的数据量超出软限制且超出倒计时，如图 3-3 所示。如果用户数据在倒计时期间继续增长，超出硬限制，则用户存储将无法写入，如图 3-4 Stax; 数据操作也会受限制，如图 3-5 所人小。Filesystem used quota Limit grace files quota Ltntt grace/Ts2 728G* 5126 iT 6d23h59m57s =Filesystem used quota Limit grace files quota Limtt grace/Ts2 728G* 5126 iT 438942 =Filesystem used quota limit files quota limit = grace/fs2 1.237 ;23\nNSC[nscctj@th-ex-1n0] $ cp test.txt test2.txtcp:writing './test2.txt':Disk quota exceededcp:writing './test2.txt':Input/Output3-5 用户数据超出磁盘配额限制的状态提示VY. wt(EIS:有的时候用户登录会出现错误提示“Some errors happened when getting quotainfo.

For test case:

  - input: 如何排查ES系统 ssh 不上计算节点的原因，给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 排查无法通过 SSH 连接 ES 系统计算节点的故障，需要从环境变量、库文件依赖和系统配置等方面进行检查，具体步骤如下：1. 检查环境变量是否干扰了 SSH 的正常运行，例如 LD_LIBRARY_PATH 是否引入了非系统库路径，导致 SSH 动态链接了错误的库文件，可以通过 ldd 命令查看 SSH 依赖的库文件路径；2. 确认计算节点是否缺少必要的库文件，如 libx11.so 等，如果登录节点有而计算节点没有，需将相关库文件拷贝到共享存储目录，并在加载脚本中添加环境变量 LD_LIBRARY_PATH，确保计算节点能正确加载库路径；3. 检查 SSH 使用的 OpenSSL 版本是否与系统兼容，若因环境变量修改导致使用了 Anaconda 中的 OpenSSL 库，应避免在环境变量中引入 Anaconda 库，确保 SSH 使用系统标准库。

  - expected output: 要排查ES系统ssh不上计算节点的原因，可按以下具体步骤进行：    1. 查看ssh报错信息，如用户遇到的“ssh: symbol lookup error: ssh: undefined symbol: EVP_KDF_ctrl, version OPENSSL_1_1_1b”，此报错是因加载Anaconda环境修改了LD_LIBRARY_PATH，使ssh动态链接了Anaconda中的库而非系统库。通过执行ldd /usr/bin/ssh命令，可查看ssh依赖的库文件路径，若显示来自非系统库路径（如Anaconda路径），则确定是环境变量问题。    2. 检查环境变量配置，查看~/.bashrc或~/.bash_profile等文件中是否有修改LD_LIBRARY_PATH的语句，特别是指向Anaconda等非系统库的路径。若有，注释或删除相关语句，然后执行source ~/.bashrc刷新环境变量，确保ssh使用系统标准库。    3. 检查计算节点的库文件是否缺失。例如TH-HPC集群计算节点缺少libx11.so库，可将登录节点的相关库文件（如libX11.so.6、libXau.so.6、libxcb.so.1）拷贝到共享存储目录，并在加载脚本中添加环境变量LD_LIBRARY_PATH。    4. 检查计算节点的网络连接是否正常，可通过ping命令测试登录节点与计算节点之间的网络连通性。同时，查看计算节点的ssh服务是否正常运行，执行systemctl status sshd命令查看ssh服务状态，若未运行，执行systemctl start sshd启动服务。    5. 检查用户权限和shell配置，如TH-HPC4系统使用ksh需加载module add loginnode，确保用户有正确的shell权限和配置，可通过echo $SHELL查看当前shell，必要时使用chsh -s /bin/ksh 用户名修改默认shell。

  - input: 如何在HPC4公共目录下部署ParaFold 2.0？
  - actual output: 在HPC4公共目录下部署ParaFold 2.0需要按照以下步骤进行：1. 安装过程包括从GitHub克隆代码、创建conda环境、安装依赖包、配置多序列比对工具，以及使用CPU和GPU进行序列预测的脚本。用户需注意参数设置，如使用-f进行特征生成，-P进行结构预测，并根据系统调整线程数。2. ParaFold 2.0是上海交大开发的AlphaFold集群版本，支持CPU和GPU分离计算，提升运算效率。安装过程中需注意Python版本为3.8，避免使用更高版本。安装依赖包时，需手动安装cudatoolkit=11.3和匹配的cudnn，避免因版本不兼容导致报错。测试中分为CPU特征生成和GPU结构预测两阶段，分别使用-f和-P参数。GPU计算需确保环境变量正确设置，并合理分配资源。整体流程稳定，但部分参数和配置需根据实际系统调整。3. 在安装过程中需要注意版本兼容性，避免因依赖冲突导致运行错误。例如，在安装conda环境时，推荐使用Python 3.8，因为版本低于3.7可能缺少某些包，而高于3.8的版本未经过测试。此外，安装依赖包时，需手动安装特定版本的软件，如cudatoolkit=11.3和cudnn，以确保与CUDA和cuDNN版本匹配。同时，还需要安装其他必要的库，如py3dmol、openmm、pdbfixer、hmmer、hhsuite等，以支持ParaFold的正常运行。最后，通过编写脚本并提交作业来测试ParaFold的功能，确保其在HPC4系统上的正确部署和运行。

  - expected output: 在HPC4公共目录部署ParaFold 2.0需按步骤完成环境搭建、依赖安装及测试。首先从GitHub克隆代码，创建Python 3.8的conda环境，安装py3dmol、openmm等依赖包，降级jaxlib匹配CUDA版本，再安装hmmer、hhsuite等多序列比对工具。接着进行序列预测测试，CPU阶段生成特征，GPU阶段预测结构，分别使用-f和-P参数，提交作业时注意资源分配。具体部署步骤如下：    1. 准备工作：登录HPC4系统，进入公共目录，确保有足够权限和存储空间。    2. 克隆代码与创建环境：执行git clone https://github.com/Zuricho/ParallelFold.git克隆代码，创建conda环境并激活，conda create prefix=/fs1/software/parallelfold/parafold python=3.8，conda activate /fs1/software/parallelfold/parafold。    3. 安装依赖包：安装基础包pip install py3dmol -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple，安装分子相关包conda install -c conda-forge openmm=7.7 pdbfixer，因自动安装的cudatoolkit可能报错，需重新安装conda install cudatoolkit=11.3 cudnn，降级jaxlibpip3 install --upgrade --no-cache-dir jax==0.3.25 jaxlib==0.3.25+cuda11.cudnn82 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple，安装多序列比对工具conda install -c bioconda hmmer=3.3.2 hhsuite=3.3.0 kalign2=2.04，赋予脚本执行权限chmod +x run_alphafold.sh。    4. 测试CPU计算产生特征：编写脚本vim run1_cpu_part.sh    5. 测试GPU计算预测结构：编写脚本vim run2_gpu_part.sh部署时需注意，Python版本必须为3.8，CUDA和cudnn版本要与jaxlib匹配，CPU计算时线程数设为8较合适，GPU计算需正确设置环境变量和资源参数。若安装过程中出现依赖冲突，可参考ColabFold安装经验，手动安装匹配版本的包，如tensorflow等。测试完成后，可根据实际需求调整参数，如模型选择、数据库类型等，以获得更好的计算效果。

For test case:

  - input: 如何为hpc2系统的qixiang账户的qixiang分区添加节点？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，为hpc2系统的qixiang账户的qixiang分区添加节点需要遵循以下步骤和注意事项：1. 分区配置方法包括对已启动节点进行隔离或关闭分区，以及对未启动节点修改配置文件并集成到启动镜像中。对于已正常运行的节点，可以通过脚本如set_nodes_partition.sh来配置不同的partition_mask实现节点隔离；若要关闭分区隔离功能，则使用close_nodes_partition.sh脚本。2. 对于未启动的节点或重启的节点，需要根据分区隔离分界的节点id进行判断，修改zninet_cpm文件中的相关值，并将修改后的文件和脚本集成到启动镜像中，使分区功能在节点启动时生效。3. 服务器分区需覆盖大部分节点以实现有效隔离，且分区最小单位为一块cpm板的8个节点，因此在添加节点时需确保符合这一最小单位要求。此外，配置过程中需要注意分区信息索引和partition_key的正确设置，以确保节点能够正确归属到指定的分区。

  - expected output: 数据库内相关内容主要涉及网络分区配置、HBA卡配置、vdevid.conf生成等，其中网络分区配置提到通过脚本对已启动节点配置partitionmask实现隔离，对未启动节点修改配置文件并集成到启动镜像中，服务器分区需覆盖大部分节点；HBA卡配置涉及获取PCI ID、配置端口别名等；vdev工具用于生成vdev_id.conf配置文件。根据经验，为hpc2系统qixiang账户的qixiang分区添加节点，可参考以下步骤：    1. 确定添加节点的范围和需求：明确需要添加到qixiang分区的节点编号及数量，了解这些节点的硬件配置和网络连接情况，确保符合分区的要求。    2. 准备配置文件和工具：获取并安装相关配置工具，如文中提到的vdev工具，确保其依赖的python2.7、lsscsi、sg_utils已安装。根据节点信息编写JBOD配置文件，如jbod.json，定义节点与JBOD的对应关系。    3. 配置网络分区：对于已启动的节点，使用/home/test641/tfq/shelltoolszni下的setnodespartition.sh脚本，输入节点列表和partitionmask（如0x801/0x802），实现节点隔离并添加到目标分区。对于未启动或需重启的节点，修改zninetcpm文件中相应节点的配置值，将修改后的zninetcpm和相关脚本交给系统管理员，集成到节点启动镜像中，使分区功能在节点启动时生效。    4. 配置HBA卡和存储连接：获取HBA卡的PCI ID，通过lspci | grep LSI命令查看。根据HBA卡与JBOD的连接关系，在/etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf文件中配置HBA卡的PORT别名，确保CHANNEL NAME正确对应分区的JBOD设备。执行udevadm trigger命令使配置生效，检查/dev/disk/by-vdev下的硬盘数量是否与实际一致。    5. 设置多路径配置：根据硬盘的WWID和别名，在multipath.conf文件中添加多路径映射配置，执行multipath -v2和multipath -v3命令生成映射，检查/dev/mapper下是否生成对应硬盘链接及数量是否正确。    6. 验证节点添加结果：添加节点后，通过系统管理工具或命令查看qixiang分区的节点列表，确认新节点已正确添加。测试节点之间的网络连通性和存储访问情况，确保分区功能正常，节点能够正常工作。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking how to adjust or change the level of jobs, but I don't have specific information on this topic., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The claim contains two main contradictions with the provided retrieval context. First, it states that Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics for relativity, which is incorrect as he was awarded in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. Second, it claims Einstein was a German chef, but the context clearly indicates he was born in Germany and moved to Italy at age five due to political reasons., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information relevant to adjusting job priorities on HPC systems. The first context is irrelevant as it discusses job scheduling and resource allocation, while the second context explicitly states that there is no relation to the query., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47058823529411764, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to Albert Einstein because it does not mention anything about his birth year, nationality, or other personal details that would be directly related to the query.'s question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何调整HPC4系统上的作业fu至最高级？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，调整HPC4系统上的作业fu至最高级需要进行以下步骤：1. 修改作业配置文件，例如在运行Fluent-UDF时需要修改run.jou文件设置路径和参数，确保案例文件、数据文件和结果文件的路径正确，并且设置合适的计算参数如时间步长和迭代次数；2. 调整作业提交脚本，例如修改fluent-singularity.sh脚本中的分区（partition）、节点数（NODE number）、每个节点的CPU核心数（cpuspernode）、日志文件名（journalfile）、计算类型（cttype）以及可执行文件路径（exe），以适配具体的计算需求和资源分配；3. 确保环境配置正确，包括加载必要的模块如CUDA和GCC，以及在编译过程中使用正确的编译器和库路径，例如在部署2D_FD_Dunzhu_Li_2014程序时需要将CUDA版本和GCC版本加载，并修改Makefile中的编译器为nvcc。此外，在运行AlphaFold2时也需要根据需求调整输入输出路径、模型选择、GPU卡号及数据库类型等参数，并通过yhbatch命令提交任务。这些步骤涵盖了从文件准备、配置修改到作业提交的整个流程，确保作业能够高效运行并获得最佳性能。

  - expected output: 在HPC4系统中，若需将作业调整至最高优先级，可参考以下通用思路及步骤：    1. 确认系统优先级机制：联系系统管理员，了解HPC4系统的作业调度策略和优先级设置规则，明确调整作业优先级的具体要求和限制。    2. 查看当前作业状态：使用yhq命令查看需要调整优先级的作业信息，包括作业ID、当前状态等，确保作业处于可调整状态。    3. 申请优先级调整：向系统管理员提交作业优先级调整申请，说明调整原因和需求，如作业的紧急程度、重要性等。    4. 管理员操作调整：若申请通过，管理员可能会使用系统管理工具或命令进行优先级调整。例如，在SLURM调度系统中，管理员可通过scancel -p或scontrol update JobId=作业ID Priority=最高优先级值等命令调整作业优先级，具体命令需根据系统实际配置确定。    5. 验证调整结果：调整后，使用yhq或squeue -j 作业ID命令查看作业优先级是否已更新为最高级，确认作业在调度队列中的位置是否提前。

The response addresses the technical aspects of the 'sbatch' command usage in batch job scheduling for high-performance computing environments., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score reflects moderate faithfulness because there are some contradictions between the claim and the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information about troubleshooting the '--mem' option specifically, and there is no mention of 'sbatch' or memory allocation errors in Fortran programs. The first context has a verdict 'yes', but it does not provide steps to resolve the issue; it only mentions removing options during compilation which doesn't directly address runtime error handling., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47619047619047616, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about slurm or srun commands, and instead talks about Einstein., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何排查slurm sbatch srun --mem --constraint参数命令无效的原因是什么？请给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 排查slurm中sbatch和srun命令的--mem和--constraint参数无效的原因，可以按照以下步骤进行：1.检查参数格式和拼写是否正确，确保没有输入错误或遗漏。2.确认所使用的slurm版本是否支持这些参数，并查阅相关文档以验证其用法。3.查看作业提交后的日志文件，寻找与内存或约束条件相关的错误信息。4.检查系统资源是否充足，例如内存是否足够满足请求，或者是否存在特定的硬件约束条件未被满足。5.验证环境变量和配置文件是否正确设置，特别是与内存和节点选择相关的配置。6.测试其他参数或简化作业脚本，以排除其他因素干扰。7.联系系统管理员，获取更详细的系统状态信息和可能的限制条件。8.参考已有的问题解决方案，如内存溢出、MPI版本问题或存储配额限制等，结合具体情况分析原因。

  - expected output: 数据库内相关内容主要涉及资源管理系统中SBATCH命令选项及环境变量的介绍，如--mem、--constraint等参数的使用，同时还有作业运行时因内存溢出、MPI版本问题、存储配额超限等导致异常的案例及解决方法。根据经验，排查slurm sbatch srun --mem --constraint参数命令无效的具体操作步骤如下：    1. 检查参数格式与拼写：确认命令中参数格式正确，像--mem=100GB需带单位且用等号连接，--constraint="gpu"约束条件用引号包裹，多条件用逗号分隔，可通过示例命令srun --mem=20GB --constraint="gpu" hostname进行验证。    2. 确认资源调度器配置：利用sinfo -o "%N %c %m %G"查看节点可用资源与约束条件是否匹配，若--constraint指定标签在节点不存在，需联系管理员添加。    3. 检查作业脚本环境变量：在批处理脚本中，通过echo SLURMMEMPERNODE或echo SLURMCONSTRAINTS验证参数是否被正确解析，若环境变量未获取参数值，可能是脚本中参数位置错误。    4. 排查内存参数有效性：查看sinfo确认节点内存，若--mem值超过节点实际容量需调整，注意未指定单位默认为MB，可测试srun -N1 --mem=10GB --pty bash申请单节点内存。    5. 检查约束条件冲突：若--constraint与其他参数冲突，如同时申请--constraint="gpu"和--no-gpus，需调整参数逻辑，并用scancel取消异常作业后重新提交。    6. 查看slurm日志与错误信息：检查/var/log/slurmctld.log，通过grep "Invalid parameter"查看参数解析错误，若提示资源不可用，说明集群无满足条件节点，需等待或调整参数。    7. 验证编译与运行环境：若作业因内存错误终止，编译时添加-g选项，使用valgrind --leak-check=yes ./myprog检查内存泄漏。

  - input: 如何为lisn用户开通ssh到服务器节点的权限？
  - actual output: 为LISN用户设置SSH访问服务器节点的权限，需要从环境配置、系统安全策略和错误排查等方面进行操作，具体包括以下几点：1. 环境变量配置：在用户的~/.bashrc文件中添加export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH，以确保SSH使用系统标准库而非第三方库如Anaconda中的库，避免因动态链接问题导致的报错。2. 系统安全加固：通过修改配置文件实现安全策略，例如在/etc/pam.d/su中禁止非wheel组用户使用su命令，在/etc/pam.d/common-password或/etc/pam.d/password-auth中设置密码复杂度要求，如密码长度不少于12位、至少包含3种字符类型等，并配置密码锁定机制防止暴力破解。3. 检查并修复SSH连接问题：若出现ssh: symbol lookup error等错误，需检查ldd输出确认SSH依赖的库路径是否正确，确保libcrypto.so.1.1等关键库来自系统目录而非Anaconda或其他第三方路径，必要时调整LD_LIBRARY_PATH环境变量或重新安装OpenSSL和SSH相关组件。4. 配置欢迎信息：在登录节点的/etc/update-motd.d/welcome或/etc/motd.d/welcome中添加欢迎信息，明确提示用户联系方式及系统使用规范。5. 日志监控与故障排查：定期查看日志文件如/auth.log、/var/log/sec等，及时发现并解决LDAP、OpenVPN或其他服务相关的异常，确保SSH服务稳定运行。

  - expected output: 根据经验，为lisn用户开通ssh到服务器节点权限，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 确认用户账号存在：检查系统中是否已有lisn用户，若没有则创建用户，命令为useradd lisn，并设置密码passwd lisn。    2. 添加用户到允许SSH组：将lisn用户添加到ssh登录允许的组，如usermod -aG sshusers lisn，若系统使用wheel组，可执行usermod -aG wheel lisn。    3. 配置SSH服务器允许登录：编辑SSH配置文件vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config，确保PermitRootLogin设置为yes或prohibit-password，确认AllowUsers或AllowGroups中包含lisn用户或所属组，如添加AllowUsers lisn，修改后重启SSH服务systemctl restart sshd。    4. 生成并配置密钥（可选）：若使用密钥登录，在lisn用户目录下生成密钥su - lisn，ssh-keygen，将公钥添加到~/.ssh/authorized_keys，设置文件权限chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys，chmod 700 ~/.ssh。    5. 检查防火墙设置：确保防火墙允许SSH端口（默认22）通信，查看防火墙状态firewall-cmd --state，开放端口firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp，重新加载防火墙firewall-cmd --reload。    6. 验证登录权限：使用lisn用户尝试SSH登录服务器ssh lisn@服务器IP，若提示密码则输入正确密码，若配置密钥则直接登录，查看是否成功。    7. 排查登录问题：若登录失败，查看SSH日志tail -f /var/log/secure，根据错误信息调整配置，如权限问题检查文件和目录权限，密钥问题检查公钥是否正确添加。

  - input: 如何释放TH-eX被用户lisn预约的节点？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，TH-eX系统中释放被用户预约的节点主要涉及任务取消和资源管理相关操作，具体步骤如下：1. 使用yhcancel命令取消用户运行的任务，通过该命令可以强制终止指定jobid的任务，从而释放被占用的节点资源。2. 在提交任务时，如果使用交互式作业提交方式（如yhrun），需要注意输入输出重定向，避免因关闭客户端导致任务中断，从而确保节点资源能够正常释放。3. 对于批处理作业提交方式（如sbatch），任务在后台运行，即使登录客户端关闭也不会影响任务执行，但若需要提前终止任务，仍需使用yhcancel命令。此外，若遇到计算节点无法启动或运行失败的问题，可尝试安装lsb包或在脚本中添加srun pty参数，以解决节点资源分配问题。总之，释放被预约节点的关键在于正确使用任务取消命令并合理管理作业提交方式。
  - expected output: 任务取消使用yhcancel命令，根据经验，释放TH-eX被用户lisn预约的节点，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 查看预约节点状态：使用yhq或yhi命令查看当前系统中节点的占用和预约情况，确定哪些节点被用户lisn预约，命令如yhi -l可获取节点详细信息。    2. 确认预约作业信息：通过yhq命令查看用户lisn的作业列表，找到对应的预约作业ID及状态，命令为yhq -u lisn。    3. 取消预约作业：若预约作业尚未开始运行，使用yhcancel命令取消该作业以释放节点，命令格式为yhcancel 作业ID。    4. 强制释放节点（特殊情况）：若作业异常或无法正常取消，联系系统管理员，通过管理员权限强制释放节点，如使用scancel命令取消作业或重置节点状态。    5. 验证节点释放结果：再次使用yhi -l命令查看节点状态，确认被预约节点已释放为可用状态。

Instead, it gives general advice on improving customer service skills which is completely unrelated to the problem., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates that there might be some inconsistencies or discrepancies between the model's response and the provided context, but it does not necessarily mean a contradiction exists; it could reflect uncertainty or partial alignment., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval result is ranked higher than the irrelevant ones because it directly addresses the user's query about troubleshooting a communication connection error in HPC systems, specifically mentioning steps to check network connectivity and node synchronization. The 'no' nodes are unrelated to the topic of Nobel Prizes or Einstein., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is relevant to the input because it provides information about Albert Einstein and his contributions, including the theory of relativity and the photoelectric effect., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: TH-HPC3系统shu账户提交作业报 Communication connection failure 错误，如何排查错误？
  - actual output: TH-HPC3系统shu账户提交作业报Communication connection failure错误，可能涉及多个方面的问题，包括节点问题、网络连接、环境配置、资源申请和权限设置等。具体排查步骤如下：1.检查节点状态和通信问题：首先确认系统存储和网络是否正常，然后检查用户作业是否有其他用户残留进程，有的话需要杀掉。接着检查节点是否有报clocksource错，如果存在此类错误，应将问题节点drain掉，并在下次提交作业时使用-x参数剔除该节点。2.检查作业提交方式和资源申请：建议使用yhbatch提交作业，因为yhbatch提交的任务不会因终端关闭或登录节点宕机而中断。同时确保yhbatch申请的资源不小于yhrun需求的资源，避免因资源不足导致通信失败。3.检查环境变量和动态库配置：如果作业运行过程中出现动态库缺失的问题，需将动态链接库的路径添加到环境变量中。例如，使用locate命令找到缺失库的地址$DIR，并在用户目录下的配置文件~/.bashrc中添加“export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH”。此外，还需确保$DIR为共享目录，以保证计算节点能够正确访问所需库。4.检查MPI运行环境和通信器配置：若作业使用MPI并出现通信器无效的错误（如MPI_Topo_test函数调用失败），可能是由于空通信器或网络问题引起。此时应联系管理员检查节点和网络状态，并确保MPI环境配置正确。5.检查权限和队列设置：若提交作业时提示权限问题（如User's group not permitted to use this partition），需使用yhi命令检查可使用的队列，并确保提交的资源不超过用户的权限限制。6.查看作业日志和系统记录：通过查看Slurm日志或其他系统日志，获取更详细的错误信息，帮助定位问题根源。例如，日志中可能出现“Job credential expired”或“bus error”等提示，这些信息有助于判断是时间同步问题、节点故障还是其他异常情况。7.联系管理员协助处理：如果上述步骤无法解决问题，建议联系系统管理员，提供具体的错误信息和作业日志，以便进一步诊断和解决通信连接失败的问题。

  - expected output: TH-HPC系统作业报Communication connection failure错误可能由多种原因导致。例如，作业断开时slurm日志出现“Job credential expired”是计算结点时间未与管理结点同步；MPI运行错误如“progress engine failure”可能由网络或节点问题引起；作业处于PD状态是因调度策略需等待；提交作业提示权限问题需检查队列和资源限制等。综合来看，可从以下方面排查shu账户提交作业报Communication connection failure的错误：    1. 检查网络连接状态：使用ping命令测试登录节点与计算节点之间的网络连通性，如ping cn2984，查看是否有丢包或延迟过高的情况。若网络不通，联系网络管理员检查网络设备和线路。    2. 查看作业调度状态：通过yhq命令查看作业状态，若作业处于PD状态，说明因调度策略在排队，需耐心等待；若状态为“S”，表示被管理员挂起，等待处理恢复。    3. 验证节点时间同步：登录计算节点，使用date命令查看时间，与管理节点时间对比，若不同步，提交作业时加-x剔除问题结点，并联系管理员同步时间。    4. 排查MPI运行错误：若slurm日志提示MPI相关错误如“progress engine failure”，可能是网络或节点故障，联系管理员检查MPI环境和节点状态。    5. 检查权限和资源限制：提交作业提示权限问题时，使用yhi命令检查可使用的队列，确认是否有权限使用指定分区，以及申请的资源是否超过限制。    6. 查看动态库依赖：若提示动态库缺失，使用locate命令找到库地址，如locate libXXX.so，将路径添加到~/.bashrc文件中，执行source ~/.bashrc生效。    7. 剔除问题节点：若确定某节点存在问题，提交作业时添加-x参数剔除该节点，如yhbatch -x cn2984 -p partition ./sub.sh。

  - retrieval context: ['TH-HPC系统常见问题包括作业断开、内存不足、动态库缺失、作业被自动退出等。解决方法包括剔除问题结点、同步时间、调整资源申请、设置环境变量、使用yhbatch提交作业等。作业处于PD状态是因调度策略，需耐心等待。作业状态“S”表示被挂起，“CG”和“comp”需管理员处理。计算慢可能与存储、网络、残留进程或节点错误有关。命令缺失可复制登录结点命令并设置环境变量。权限问题需检查队列和资源限制。$SLURM_NPROCS对应PBS的$PBS_NODELINE。MPI运行错误可能由网络或节点问题引起，需联系管理员。',

  - actual output: TH-eX系统上运行作业出现Bus error错误时，可以按照以下步骤进行排查和解决1. 首先检查脚本执行方式是否正确，如果使用后台执行命令导致yhrun任务在脚本结束后提前回收节点，应移除最后一个命令的&符号或完善脚本监控所有进程结束再退出，确保任务正常完成2. 检查编译过程中是否存在BOZ字面量常量错误或符号未定义的问题，如果是则需要在Macros.make文件的FFLAGS中添加`-fallow-invalid-boz`参数3. 如果是由于链接时缺少LAPACK库函数引用，应在构建命令中添加LAPACK和OpenBLAS库路径及链接参数4. 对于资源不足或内存分配不当导致的“Requested nodes are busy”错误，可以尝试减少核数、限制内存使用或使用mpi-n编译的程序并用mpirun调用同时建议设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1以优化计算效率5. 确保所有依赖库和环境配置正确，避免因库缺失或版本不兼容导致的Bus error错误6. 检查作业提交脚本中的参数设置是否合理，如节点数、内存限制等，确保符合系统资源分配要求7. 查看作业日志和输出文件，寻找可能的错误信息或异常行为，以便进一步定位问题根源8. 如果以上方法无法解决问题，可以联系系统管理员或技术支持团队获取更详细的帮助和指导。

  - expected output: 要排查TH-eX上运行作业报Bus error的错误，具体排查步骤如下：    1. 检查硬件连接与状态：查看GPU、内存等硬件是否连接松动或存在故障，可尝试重启节点或更换硬件设备。    2. 确认内存使用情况：使用free -h命令查看系统内存使用情况，若内存不足，调整作业申请的内存量，在yhrun命令中添加mem=XXGB参数。    3. 优化作业脚本：检查脚本中是否存在后台执行命令导致节点提前回收的情况，如TH-ES系统案例，移除脚本中最后一行的&符号，或完善脚本监控所有进程结束再退出。    4. 调整资源分配：参考TH-3F系统案例，若使用64核作业存在问题，尝试将核数改为56核，减少资源占用。    5. 检查编译与运行环境：确保程序编译时的环境与运行时一致，避免因AVX支持等问题导致错误，必要时移除-xHOST/-xAVX等优化选项。    6. 查看系统日志：通过tail -f /var/log/messages等命令查看系统日志，获取更多错误细节，辅助定位问题。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not address the question about how to handle drain problems in a network system, but instead discusses general advice on handling failures without specific steps for drains., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score reflects moderate alignment with the retrieved context, indicating some agreement but also notable discrepancies., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about how to handle the node with a verdict of no in the retrieval contexts. The retrieval context nodes are ranked from most relevant at rank 1 (highest) to least relevant at higher ranks, so lower-ranked nodes have less relevance and should be addressed first., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.55, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not address the user's query about handling drain nodes or any related technical process, and instead provides unrelated information about Einstein., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何处理drain的fn2节点，给出具体步骤？
  - actual output: 处理drain的fn2节点的具体步骤如下：1. 确认drain节点列表，通过命令yhi –R | grep [reason]获取被drain的节点列表，例如Hold_on_0531；2. 验证节点状态，使用yhi –n $drain_nodelist –p ALL命令确认其中的正常开机节点列表；3. 清除节点的dmesg信息，进入指定目录并运行脚本./zni_clean_dmesg_inband.sh，后接节点列表；4. 检查节点间的网络连通性，确保节点之间可以正常通信；5. 如果需要，可以通过ccst [机框号]命令查看机框节点列表，进一步确认节点状态和分布情况。

  - expected output: 通过yhi -R | grep 原因获取drain节点列表，再用yhi -n 节点列表 -p ALL确认正常开机节点，还可清除节点dmesg信息及检查节点间pping。具体处理步骤如下：    1. 确认drain原因与节点列表：在管理节点执行yhi -R | grep drain原因（如yhi -R | grep Hold_on_0531），获取被drain的节点列表$drain_nodelist。    2. 筛选正常开机节点：使用yhi -n $drain_nodelist -p ALL命令，从drain节点中筛选出实际正常开机的节点列表$nodelist。    3. 清除节点dmesg信息：进入/home/test641/1903-networkmanager-1.0/loop_alltoall_test目录，执行./zni_clean_dmesg_inband.sh $nodelist，清除正常开机节点的dmesg信息。    4. 检查节点间网络连通性：在同一目录下，使用./zni_check_pping_相关脚本，对$nodelist中的节点进行网络连通性检查，确保节点间通信正常。    5. 解除节点drain状态：若确认节点无硬件故障且网络正常，通过管理工具或命令解除节点的drain状态，例如使用scontrol update NodeName=fn2 State=idle（具体命令需根据系统实际情况调整）。    6. 验证节点状态：执行yhi或sinfo命令，查看fn2节点状态是否恢复为idle或up，确认处理成功。

For test case:

  - input: 如何在TH-eX上查询作业报错信息？
  - actual output: 在TH-eX平台上获取作业错误信息可以通过以下几种方式：1. 通过查看作业的jobid来获取详细信息，用户可以根据自己的作业情况填入相应的jobid，之后可以看到该作业的详细信息。如果作业长时间处于CG状态，表示作业没有正常退出，系统管理员会定期扫描并处理CG状态的作业；如果作业变为$状态，表示系统正在维护，维护完成后会恢复。2. 用户可以使用yhq命令查看作业的jobid，然后通过yhbatch或yhrun提交作业时，注意检查作业脚本中的资源申请是否满足需求，例如MPI并行作业需要确保申请的资源不小于脚本中的需求，而OpenMP作业只能在单节点运行，线程数不超过56。3. 如果作业出现错误，用户可以检查作业脚本中是否有语法错误或资源申请不当的情况，同时也可以查看作业输出文件中的错误信息，通常这些信息会保存在以slurm开头的.out文件中。此外，用户还可以根据系统管理员的提示或相关文档进行排查和解决。

  - expected output: 在TH-eX上查询作业报错信息，可通过系统提供的工具和作业输出文件获取。作业通过jobid标识，用户可使用yhq命令查看作业明细，作业长时间处于CG状态表示未正常退出，变为$状态表示系统维护中。批处理作业默认生成以slurm开头的.out文件，存储输出信息。具体查询步骤如下：    1. 获取作业ID：使用yhq命令查看当前用户提交的作业列表，获取需要查询的作业ID。    2. 查看作业明细：通过yhq 作业ID命令，查看该作业的详细信息，包括运行状态、节点分配等。    3. 查看作业输出文件：批处理作业在运行过程中会在脚本所在目录生成以slurm开头的.out文件，如slurm-作业ID.out，通过cat或less命令查看该文件，获取报错信息。    4. 查看系统日志：若作业异常终止，可查看系统日志/var/log/slurmctld.log或/var/log/slurmd.log，搜索作业ID获取更详细的错误信息。    5. 检查作业状态：若作业处于CG状态，表示未正常退出，等待系统管理员处理；若为$状态，说明系统维护中，维护完成后作业会恢复。

  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.48, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Einstein's nationality or birthplace, and the user query specifically asks for information on how to add -reservation=x11 permissions., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何在TH-eX上为liangyx用户添加 —reservation=x11权限？
  - actual output: 为用户 liangyx 在 TH-eX 上分配 —reservation=x11 权限，可以按照以下步骤进行：1. 提交 mantis 申请：用户需要通过提交 mantis 请求，让管理员为其添加 reservation=x11 权限。这是访问 EX 计算节点图形化界面的必要步骤。2. 管理员处理请求：管理员收到 mantis 申请后，会根据系统规则和用户需求，审核并执行权限的添加操作。3. 用户启动 VNC：权限分配完成后，用户可以通过加载 vnc 模块并设置密码来启动 VNC 服务。具体命令包括 module load vnc/3.0.3 和 vncserver :1。4. 连接 VNC：使用 vncviewer 命令连接到指定的 IP 地址和端口，并输入用户名和密码完成连接。对于 Windows 用户，可以安装 VNC Viewer 软件并通过 SSH 端口转发实现连接。5. 验证权限：用户在成功连接 VNC 后，应确保能够正常访问图形化界面并执行相关操作，以确认 reservation=x11 权限已正确分配。

  - expected output: 要在TH-eX上为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限，需通过系统管理流程申请。EX计算节点使用VNC图形化界面时，用户需提交mantis申请，由管理员添加reservation=x11权限。此外，运行FLOW-3D软件时，使用add_user命令为用户添加权限。具体步骤如下：    1. 提交权限申请：通过mantis系统提交申请，说明需要为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限，注明用途（如使用VNC图形界面）。    2. 管理员审核与添加：管理员收到申请后，使用系统管理工具为liangyx用户添加—reservation=x11权限。若涉及特定软件权限（如FLOW-3D），可参考add_user命令格式，由管理员执行类似add_user flow3d liangyx 支持专员用户名的操作。    3. 验证权限生效：用户登录系统后，尝试启动需要—reservation=x11权限的功能（如VNC），执行module load vnc/3.0.3后启动vncserver :1，若能正常设置密码并启动服务，说明权限已生效。完成权限添加后，用户即可在TH-eX系统上使用需要—reservation=x11权限的功能，如通过VNC进行图形化操作。

  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about granting permissions or access to a specific account (liuyuansh) on a system, which falls under the category of security and authorization. The provided retrieval contexts do not contain any information related to Redhat systems, let alone HPC clusters with multiple nodes like TH-HPC4. There is no mention of user accounts, permissions, or node management in these contexts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer as there's insufficient context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about "liuyuansharp", so it cannot be used to answer the user query., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何在Redhat系统的TH-HPC4上为liuyuansharp账户开通 visual 分区和5个节点权限？
  - actual output: 为liuyuansharp用户在TH-HPC4系统上分配visual分区及5个节点的访问权限，需要按照以下步骤操作：1.首先需要确认用户是否已经拥有相应的权限，如果没有，需要通过管理员或支持专员进行权限添加。2.对于TH-HPC4系统，配置orca503软件需要使用rsync命令将软件从共享目录拷贝到用户目录下，具体命令为rsync -ltrvP zhenggang4@th-hpc4-ln1:/fs1/software/commerial/orca/orca503 .，其中zhenggang4是支持专员账号，用户需要输入该账号的密码完成拷贝。3.完成拷贝后，用户需要参考orca503目录下的sub-orca.sh脚本进行使用，确保环境变量和模块加载正确。4.如果用户需要访问visual分区，可能需要通过yhinfo命令查看分区信息，并根据需要调整作业提交策略，例如在脚本中设置CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES来指定GPU设备号，或者在程序中直接指定设备号以避免资源浪费。5.此外，用户还需要确保其.bashrc文件中设置了正确的MODULEPATH，以便加载所需的模块，如module add pytorch/1.11.0-cu11.3-py3.9等。6.最后，用户应测试其权限和配置是否正确，可以通过运行简单的测试作业来验证visual分区和节点的访问情况。

  - expected output: HPC4的GPU分区配置需通过模块加载和脚本提交作业，配置orca软件时在TH-HPC1~3使用add_user命令添加权限，TH-HPC4则需拷贝软件至用户目录；yhinfo命令可查看节点和分区信息，帮助确认资源状态。具体步骤如下：    1. 确认visual分区存在与权限要求：使用yhinfo -p visual查看visual分区是否存在及权限要求，确认该分区允许的节点数和用户权限限制。    2. 申请权限开通：通过系统管理流程提交申请，说明为liuyuansharp账户开通visual分区及5个节点权限的需求，附使用场景和资源规划。    3. 管理员添加分区权限：管理员登录系统，使用权限管理工具为liuyuansharp账户添加visual分区访问权限，确保账户可提交该分区作业。    4. 配置节点资源配额：管理员通过yhacctmgr命令为账户设置节点资源配额，如yhacctmgr modify liuyuansharp --max-nodes=5 --partition=visual，限制单作业最多使用5个节点。    5. 验证权限与资源：liuyuansharp登录TH-HPC4，执行yhinfo -p visual确认分区可访问，使用yhbatch提交测试作业，如yhbatch -N 5 -p visual test.sh，查看是否成功分配5个节点。

  - expected output: 在TH-eX系统中，要在指定路径下提交脚本，需结合系统作业提交机制与路径操作。如通过yhbatch命令提交批处理脚本，批量提交作业时需将脚本复制到目标文件夹后提交，还提到了提交脚本时的环境变量设置、模块加载以及临时脚本生成等相关内容。具体提交步骤如下：    1. 进入目标路径：使用cd命令进入脚本所在目录，即cd /fs2/home/wangrong/software/ABCluster/testfiles/isomer。    2. 确认脚本存在：通过ls命令查看目录下是否存在sub.sh脚本，确保脚本已正确放置在该路径下。    3. 提交作业：使用yhbatch命令提交脚本，命令为yhbatch sub.sh。提交后系统会返回作业ID，可通过该ID查看作业状态。    4. 查看作业状态：提交完成后，使用yhq命令查看作业是否正常进入队列，确认作业ID及状态。在提交过程中，若脚本需要特定环境变量或模块支持，需在sub.sh脚本中添加相应的环境配置，如加载所需模块、设置环境变量等，以确保脚本在计算节点上正常运行。

For test case:

  - input: 如何取消 TH-eX 预约队列 cesm 并释放节点到 cp6 分区中？给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，取消 TH-eX 预约队列中的 CESM 作业并释放相关节点至 cp6 分区的具体操作步骤如下：1. 使用 yhcancel 命令取消作业，需要知道作业的 jobid，可以通过 yhq 命令查看当前运行的作业列表，找到对应的 jobid 后执行 yhcancel jobid 命令来取消作业。2. 取消作业后，系统会自动释放占用的节点资源，这些节点将回到可用状态，并可能被分配到 cp6 分区中用于其他作业。3. 如果作业是通过指定脚本提交的，例如使用了SBATCH参数设置及环境变量导出的脚本，在取消作业后，建议检查脚本中的分区设置是否正确，确保后续作业能够正确提交到 cp6 分区。需要注意的是，取消作业后，如果需要重新运行作业，应确保脚本中的参数和环境变量配置正确，并且符合 cp6 分区的资源要求。此外，若在取消作业过程中遇到问题，可以联系技术支持获取帮助。

  - expected output: 取消TH-eX预约队列可使用yhcancel jobid命令，其中jobid通过yhq获取，且提交作业时可通过#SBATCH -p cp6指定分区，这些为取消预约队列并释放节点到cp6分区提供了操作基础。根据经验，具体操作步骤如下：    1. 查询cesm预约队列的作业ID：使用yhq命令查看当前所有作业，找到属于cesm预约队列的作业ID。    2. 取消cesm预约队列作业：通过yhcancel 作业ID命令取消该作业，释放其占用的节点资源。    3. 确认节点释放状态：执行yhi -l命令，查看节点详细信息，确认原cesm队列占用的节点已变为可用状态。    4. 将节点分配至cp6分区：联系系统管理员，通过管理工具将释放的节点分配到cp6分区；或编写提交脚本，在脚本中使用#SBATCH -p cp6指定分区，然后通过yhbatch 脚本名提交作业，使节点调度到cp6分区。    5. 验证节点分配结果：使用yhi -p cp6命令，查看cp6分区的节点列表，确认释放的节点已成功分配到该分区。

  - expected output: 可通过yhcontrol命令管理预约资源，例如创建预约时指定节点数、更新已有预约的节点数量等，且用户资源调整需符合系统配额限制，超出合同范围需申请修改。根据经验，将TH-eX chenx账号预约的保留资源调整为200个节点，具体步骤如下：    1. 查询当前预约信息：使用yhcontrol show reservation命令查看chenx账号现有的预约名称及节点数，找到对应的预约名称。    2. 更新预约节点数：假设预约名称为“chenxres”，执行yhcontrol update Reservation=chenxres NodeCnt=200命令，将节点数调整为200。    3. 验证调整结果：再次执行yhcontrol show reservation=chenx_res命令，确认节点数已更新为200，确保调整成功。若需新建预约，可直接执行yhcontrol create res StartTime=具体时间 Duration=持续时长 Users=chenx NodeCnt=200命令，创建包含200个节点的预约资源。操作时需注意用户权限是否符合系统配额限制，若提示权限不足，需联系管理员进行账号资源上限调整。

  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.6363636363636364, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context does not mention anything about Pytorch or CUDA, so it's irrelevant., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 遇到PyTorch版本不匹配导致CUDA不可用的问题，请给出解决方案。
  - actual output: 遇到PyTorch版本不匹配导致CUDA不可用的问题，可以通过以下方法解决：1. 创建新的conda环境并安装指定版本的PyTorch、torchvision和torchaudio，同时安装对应的CUDA Toolkit。例如，安装PyTorch 1.12.1、torchvision 0.13.1、torchaudio 0.12.1和CUDA Toolkit 11.6。2. 如果出现CondaVerificationError或ClobberError错误，可能是由于CUDA库损坏或路径冲突，可以尝试清理缓存、重新下载包或调整环境配置。3. 确保安装的PyTorch版本与系统CUDA版本兼容，例如当系统CUDA版本为11.4时，应安装与CUDA 11.3兼容的PyTorch 1.10.1版本，并通过conda安装命令完成安装。

  - expected output: 云主机中，通过创建新的conda环境，安装PyTorch 1.12.1、torchvision 0.13.1、torchaudio 0.12.1，并搭配CUDA Toolkit 11.6，解决了PyTorch版本不匹配导致的CUDA不可用问题，安装后测试成功，CUDA可用。TIB - GPU系统安装PyTorch包时出现CondaVerificationError和ClobberError错误，前者是多个CUDA库（如libcusolver、libnpp）的包损坏，表现为文件路径缺失或文件大小不匹配；后者是不同包共享相同路径（如bin/cjpeg、bin/djpeg）所致。系统中NVIDIA A100 GPU的CUDA版本为11.4，使用CUDA 10.2的PyTorch时出现不兼容警告，建议安装与CUDA 11.3兼容的PyTorch 1.10.1版本，并通过conda命令完成安装。问题原因分析：    1. PyTorch与CUDA版本不匹配：PyTorch对CUDA版本有严格要求，若安装的PyTorch版本对应的CUDA版本与系统实际CUDA版本不一致，会导致CUDA不可用。例如，系统CUDA为11.4，而使用CUDA 10.2的PyTorch就会出现不兼容警告。    2. 安装包损坏或冲突：安装过程中包损坏（如libcusolver、libnpp等CUDA库文件缺失或大小错误），或不同包共享相同路径（如jpeg相关包的bin/cjpeg、bin/djpeg路径冲突），会引发安装错误，进而导致CUDA不可用。    3. 环境配置问题：已存在的conda环境可能存在配置冲突，影响PyTorch与CUDA的正常关联。解决方案：    1. 创建新conda环境并安装匹配版本：        a. 创建新环境：conda create -n torch_env python=3.8        b 激活环境：conda activate torch_env。        c. 安装匹配的PyTorch及相关包，根据系统CUDA版本选择：            若系统CUDA为11.6，安装：conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge。            若系统CUDA为11.3，安装：conda install pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch。    2. 解决安装包问题：        a. 清理conda缓存：conda clean -i（清理索引缓存）、conda clean -p（清理未使用的包）、conda clean -t（清理临时文件）。        b. 重新下载安装包：删除损坏的包后重新安装，如conda remove libcusolver libnpp，再重新执行安装命令。        c. 处理包冲突：若出现ClobberError，可尝试指定具体包版本或使用--force-reinstall强制重装，如conda install jpeg=9d -f。    3. 验证CUDA可用性：安装完成后，进入Python环境，输入import torch，print(torch.cuda.is_available())，若输出True，则CUDA可用；同时可查看支持的CUDA设备：print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))。

For test case:

  - input: 如何在eX集群安装FIPS软件，用root权限生成机器码来配置license？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，在eX集群上安装FIPS软件并以root身份生成机器码用于许可证配置的步骤如下：1. 环境准备和模块加载：首先需要加载必要的编译器和库模块，例如MPI、grib_api、pnetcdf等，这些模块通常通过module add命令进行加载，确保编译环境正确配置。2. 获取源代码和设置路径：使用git克隆FLEXPART代码或者从其他来源获取FIPS软件的源代码，并将源代码目录切换到相应的位置，同时设置环境变量如LD_LIBRARY_PATH，确保程序能够找到所需的库文件。3. 修改makefile配置：进入源码目录后，需要修改makefile中的路径和编译器参数，包括ROOT_DIR、F90、MPIF90及库路径等，确保编译器和链接器能够正确识别所需的库和头文件位置。4. 编译和安装：完成makefile的修改后，执行编译命令进行编译安装，确保FIPS软件能够正确编译并生成可执行文件。5. 生成机器码：在安装完成后，以root权限运行相应的命令或脚本生成机器码，通常这一步可能涉及调用特定的工具或命令行参数，具体取决于FIPS软件的安装和配置要求。6. 配置许可证：最后，使用生成的机器码配置许可证文件，确保软件能够正确识别并激活许可证，从而完成整个安装和配置过程。需要注意的是，具体的命令和路径可能会因系统环境和软件版本的不同而有所差异，建议参考官方文档或技术支持获取更详细的指导。

  - expected output: 根据经验，在eX集群安装FIPS软件并使用root权限生成机器码配置license，可按以下步骤操作：    1. 准备安装环境：使用root账号登录eX集群，确保系统具备编译所需的依赖，如GCC、CMake、make等工具，安装命令如yum install gcc cmake make（适用于CentOS/RHEL系统）。    2. 获取FIPS软件安装包：将FIPS软件安装包上传至集群，例如放置在/opt目录下，使用tar -xzf fips-xxx.tar.gz解压。    3. 配置编译参数：进入解压后的源码目录，修改编译配置文件（如Makefile或CMakeLists.txt），指定安装路径和依赖库路径。若需使用MPI编译，加载相应模块：module load MPI/mpich/xxx。    4. 编译并安装软件：执行编译命令，如make && make install，安装完成后确认可执行文件路径（如/usr/local/fips/bin）。    5. 生成机器码：运行FIPS软件的机器码生成工具，通常命令为fips_gen_machine_code，生成的机器码文件（如machine_code.txt）会包含硬件信息。    6. 配置license文件：将生成的机器码发送至license供应商，获取license文件后，放置在指定目录（如/usr/local/fips/license），并修改环境变量指向该文件：export FIPS_LICENSE=/usr/local/fips/license/license.dat。    7. 验证安装与license配置：运行FIPS软件测试案例，检查是否成功加载license，例如执行fips_test -v，查看输出中是否显示license有效信息。

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user query asks about the differences between login nodes and compute nodes in HPC systems, specifically regarding what users can do on each. The answer provided does not address this question directly or indirectly. It describes general aspects of HPC clusters but doesn't specify operations allowed on login nodes versus compute nodes. While it mentions that login nodes are for user access and compute nodes handle computations, the key distinction in terms of user permissions is missing. Compute nodes typically require job scheduling systems like Slurm to allocate resources, so users cannot directly run jobs or use GPUs there without proper allocation; they can only do so after being granted access by a scheduler., error: None)

The retrieval contexts provided include information on authentication mechanisms for login nodes versus restricted access for compute nodes, which directly addresses the functional distinction mentioned by the user. However, the answer does not explicitly compare or contrast these two aspects; it only mentions that both are part of a high-performance computing system but doesn't elaborate on their specific differences in functionality and security measures as per the query's focus., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: HPC4系统的登陆节点和计算节点在功能上有何主要区别？用户在这些节点上分别被允许和禁止执行哪些操作？
  - actual output: HPC4系统的登陆节点和计算节点在功能上有明显区别，登陆节点主要用于用户登录和作业提交，而计算节点用于实际的计算任务执行。用户在登陆节点上被允许执行作业提交、脚本编写和环境配置等操作，但禁止直接在登陆节点上运行计算密集型任务。用户在计算节点上被允许执行计算任务，但禁止进行系统级操作和修改配置。1. 登陆节点的功能和限制：登陆节点主要提供用户访问系统的入口，用户可以在此进行代码编辑、作业脚本编写和作业提交等操作。禁止在登陆节点上运行长时间或高资源消耗的计算任务，以避免影响其他用户的使用。2. 计算节点的功能和限制：计算节点负责执行用户提交的计算任务，用户可以在这些节点上运行程序和算法。禁止用户在计算节点上进行系统配置、软件安装或修改安全策略等操作，以确保系统的稳定性和安全性。3. 用户权限和操作限制：在登陆节点上，用户被允许使用常见的命令和工具，但禁止使用root权限进行操作。在计算节点上，用户被限制访问系统文件和目录，只能在自己的工作目录中进行操作。同时，用户不能在计算节点上直接修改系统配置文件或执行可能影响其他用户的操作。

  - expected output: HPC4系统的登陆节点和计算节点在功能上存在明显差异，这是由集群的设计架构和安全策略决定的。登陆节点是用户与集群交互的入口，而计算节点是执行实际计算任务的核心资源。根据经验，HPC4系统的登陆节点和计算节点的主要区别及用户操作限制如下：    1. 登陆节点        1). 功能：主要作为用户与集群的交互接口，用于用户登录、作业管理、环境配置、软件安装（用户权限内）等操作。用户可以在登陆节点上编写、编辑和调试脚本，提交作业到计算节点，查看作业状态和输出结果，以及进行一些简单的数据处理。        2). 允许操作：用户可以登录并进行Shell交互，使用文本编辑器（如vi、vim）编辑文件；提交作业到计算节点，例如使用yhbatch或yhrun命令；查看集群状态和作业信息，如使用yhq、yhi等命令；配置个人环境变量，如在~/.bashrc中添加路径等；进行数据传输，如使用scp、sftp等命令上传下载文件。        3). 禁止操作：禁止在登陆节点上运行大规模计算任务，以免占用过多资源影响其他用户登录和作业提交；禁止修改系统级配置文件，如/etc下的重要文件；未经允许，禁止安装系统级软件或修改系统环境。    2. 计算节点        1). 功能：是集群的计算核心，专门用于执行用户提交的计算作业，提供CPU、GPU等计算资源和内存、存储等资源。        2). 允许操作：运行用户提交的计算作业，如科学计算程序、机器学习任务等；作业可以访问分配给它的计算资源，如CPU核数、内存、GPU等；作业可以读取和写入共享存储中的数据。        3). 禁止操作：用户不能直接登录计算节点（除非作业分配到该节点且通过特定方式），一般通过作业调度系统访问；禁止在计算节点上进行交互式操作，如直接运行Shell命令（除作业脚本内的命令）；禁止修改计算节点的系统配置和环境，如卸载或加载系统模块等；禁止在计算节点上保留无关文件或进程，以免影响其他作业运行。

  - input: 如何通过Modules工具加载Intel编译器和IMPI环境？请写出具体命令并说明模块命名规则。
  - actual output: 通过Modules工具加载Intel编译器和IMPI环境需要使用`module add`命令并遵循特定的模块命名规则，具体步骤如下：1. 加载Intel编译器模块，例如`module add Intel_compiler/版本号`，其中版本号根据实际安装情况而定；2. 加载IMPI（如OpenMPI或MVAPICH2）模块，例如`module add MPI/模块名`，模块名通常包含MPI实现名称、版本号及编译器信息；3. 使用`module li`验证模块是否成功加载。模块命名规则一般为“组件类型/组件名称/版本号-编译器信息”，例如`MPI/openmpi/4.1.5-mpi-x-gcc8.5-ucx-mt`。具体的命令示例包括`module add Intel_compiler/19.1.2`和`module add MPI/mvapich2/2.3.6-icc19.1`。此外，某些情况下可能需要同时加载其他依赖模块，如FFTW等。

  - expected output:  要通过Modules工具加载Intel编译器和IMPI环境，需先了解模块命名规则。通常模块命名会包含软件名称、版本号以及相关依赖信息，例如Intel_compiler/19.1.2中，“Intel_compiler”是软件名称，“19.1.2”是版本号；MPI/mvapich2/2.3.6-icc19.1中，“MPI”是大类，“mvapich2”是具体实现，“2.3.6”是版本号，“icc19.1”表示与Intel编译器19.1版本相关。根据经验，具体操作如下：    1. 加载Intel编译器，可使用类似module add Intel_compiler/19.1.2的命令，根据实际环境中的模块名称调整版本号。    2. 加载IMPI环境，需找到对应的IMPI模块，例如若存在MPI/impi/2021.9.0这样的模块，即可执行module add MPI/impi/2021.9.0来加载。    3. 加载完成后，可通过module li命令查看已加载的模块，确认Intel编译器和IMPI环境是否成功加载。    4. 若需要卸载，可使用module rm命令，如module rm Intel_compiler/19.1.2。在实际操作中，需根据系统中实际存在的模块名称进行操作，可通过module avail命令查看可用的Intel编译器和IMPI相关模块，再选择合适的版本进行加载。

For test case:

  - input: 用户需在HPC4系统上提交一个MPI+OpenMP混合并行作业，要求使用2个计算节点，每个节点运行4进程，每进程开启9线程。请编写对应的作业脚本并说明参数含义。
  - actual output: 1. 作业脚本需要配置MPI和OpenMP参数，确保正确调用容器和环境变量：在HPC4系统上提交MPI+OpenMP混合并行作业时，需编写包含环境变量设置和执行命令的脚本。根据提供的内容，可以参考以下脚本结构：#!/bin/bash#SBATCH -N 2#SBATCH -n 8#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=9module add singularity/3.11.0export OMP_NUM_THREADS=9export I_MPI_SHM_LMT=shmsrun singularity exec env I_MPI_SHM_LMT=$I_MPI_SHM_LMT env PERLLIB=${PERLLIB} env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} env PATH=${PATH} workdir=${PWD} /fs2/software/node/redhat-7.2.sif ./par.exe。该脚本使用了Slurm调度器，指定了2个计算节点，每个节点运行4个进程，每个进程开启9个线程，并设置了必要的环境变量。  \n2. 参数含义包括：SBATCH -N 2表示使用2个计算节点，SBATCH -n 8表示总共运行8个进程，SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4表示每个节点运行4个进程，SBATCH --cpus-per-task=9表示每个进程开启9个线程。同时，export OMP_NUM_THREADS=9用于设置OpenMP线程数，export I_MPI_SHM_LMT=shm用于避免MPI错误，srun singularity exec用于执行Singularity容器中的程序。  \n3. 环境变量和依赖库的配置：在脚本中需要设置PERLLIB、LD_LIBRARY_PATH、PATH等环境变量，以确保容器内正确加载依赖库。例如，export PERLLIB=${PERLLIB}用于设置Perl库路径，export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}用于设置动态链接库路径，export PATH=${PATH}用于设置可执行文件路径。此外，还需要确保Singularity镜像路径正确，如/fs2/software/node/redhat-7.2.sif。
 
  - expected output: 在 HPC4 系统提交作业的相关脚本中，使用 SBATCH 参数如#SBATCH -n 256设置总进程数，#SBATCH partition=gpu3指定分区，#SBATCH -N 1等设置节点和 GPU 资源，加载模块后用 mpirun -np 1 运行程序并设置 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 控制线程数。根据经验在HPC4系统上提交MPI+OpenMP混合并行作业时，具体步骤如下：    1. 作业脚本需要使用SBATCH指令来设置作业的基本属性和资源需求。例如，通过#SBATCH -J jobname设置作业名称，方便识别；#SBATCH -o joboutput.log和#SBATCH -e joberror.log分别指定标准输出和错误输出的日志文件路径。    2. 在资源分配方面，#SBATCH -N 2表示使用2个计算节点，#SBATCH -n 8（2个节点×4进程/节点）设置总进程数为8，#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=9为每个进程分配9个CPU核心，用于OpenMP线程。同时，需要指定作业提交的分区，如#SBATCH -p compute（假设compute为计算分区）。    3. 加载所需的MPI和OpenMP相关模块，例如module load MPI/openmpi/4.1.3，确保系统中存在对应的模块。然后设置环境变量，如export OMP_NUM_THREADS=9，指定每个进程开启的OpenMP线程数。    4. 在运行作业时，使用mpirun或srun命令来启动MPI程序。例如，mpirun -n 8 -ppn 4 -threads 9 program，其中-n 8表示总进程数，-ppn 4指定每个节点运行4个进程，-threads 9为每个进程分配9个线程。    5. 考虑HPC系统的特定参数，如#SBATCH --mpi=pmi2设置MPI类型为PMI2，避免兼容性问题；#SBATCH --time=02:00:00设置作业的最大运行时间为2小时。    6. 确保程序的执行命令正确，例如mpirun -n 8 -ppn 4 -threads 9 ./my_mpi_omp_program，其中my_mpi_omp_program为编译好的可执行文件。

The answer should be more focused on providing instructions for performing these operations specifically within an HPC context., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided response, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts are relevant and directly address the user's query about using vi editor (or similar) to edit specific lines of a file. The first context mentions editing makefile files, which is related to configuration files that might be involved in such operations, and the second one also discusses editing config files with vi/vim editors. Both contexts are on-topic., error: None)

  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval result has a verdict of yes for node 1 and no for node 2. The first context (node 1) provides information on checking job status with 'pestat' command, which is directly relevant to the user's query about viewing job status. However, the second context (node 2) does not relate to batch processing or Slurm commands., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.56, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide any information about batch job management commands or how to check status and cancel jobs in HPC systems, instead focusing on Albert Einstein's biography., error: None)

However, it did not specifically address how to use Lustre with HPC (HPC) systems or provide specific instructions for using Lustre in high-performance computing environments. The response focused on general storage solutions without addressing the user's query about HPC usage., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user mentioned Einstein winning a Nobel Prize but did not specify which field it was in. The retrieval context states that he won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the光电效应 (photoelectric effect), while the actual output says he won for relativity, creating a contradiction., error: None)

  - input: 用户在使用HPC4系统的Lustre分布式存储时需要注意哪些关键事项？请说明软限制和硬限制的具体含义。
  - actual output: 用户在使用HPC4系统的Lustre分布式存储时，应关注的关键配置和使用注意事项包括：1.存储设备的RAID配置需要注意避免使用带有板载缓存的PCI适配卡，以防止HA故障转移时数据不一致；格式化RAID设备时需确保IO请求与底层RAID匹配，以提升性能；对于RAID 5、6或1+0，需指定参数优化元数据布局；计算stripe width时，应使条带宽度匹配IO大小，避免“读-修改-写”操作；建议将OST日志放在单独设备上，使用RAID 1阵列，并确保内存足够存储日志副本。2.网络配置方面，Lustre文件系统需要专用TCP/IP子网或InfiniBand网络，正确配置LNet模块，识别运行有Lustre软件的所有设备和网络接口，确定路由节点，排除不必要的网络接口，简化复杂网络配置。3.内存和存储配置方面，非故障切换配置下，8个OST的OSS至少需要32GB RAM，而故障切换配置则需至少48GB RAM，每个OST需要6GB内存；存储建议使用RAID，MDT推荐RAID 1或RAID 10，OST推荐RAID 6以提供双重冗余；RAID配置需考虑性能与成本平衡，并配备RAID监控和热备磁盘以提高可靠性。软限制和硬限制是Lustre文件系统中用于管理存储资源的两种配额机制。软限制是指用户或组在存储空间或文件数量上的上限，当接近该限制时，系统会发出警告，但允许用户继续写入直到达到硬限制。硬限制则是绝对的上限，一旦达到，用户将无法再进行任何写入操作。实际影响方面，软限制有助于提前预警潜在的存储问题，而硬限制则确保不会超出系统设定的最大容量，从而保护系统的稳定性和数据完整性。此外，授权缓存机制允许数据在超过OST配额时仍能成功写入，这可能导致配额限制失效，因此需要通过调整客户端参数来缓解这一问题。

  - expected output: 在HPC4系统中使用Lustre分布式存储时，有诸多关键事项需要注意，具体如下：    1. 存储配置方面，要确保有足够的RAM，非故障切换配置下使用8个OST的OSS至少需32GB RAM，故障切换配置至少需48GB RAM，每个OST需要6GB内存，同时存储设备建议配置为RAID，MDT推荐RAID1或RAID10，OST推荐RAID6，格式化时要通过--mkfsoptions参数确保IO请求与底层RAID匹配，以提升性能。    2. 配额管理方面，要注意授权缓存可能导致配额限制失效，可运行lctl set param osc.*.max_dirty_mb=825来减少客户端授权缓存最大值，同时要明确软限制和硬限制的含义，软限制是一种警告性的配额限制，当用户使用的资源超过软限制时，系统会发出警告，但不会立即阻止用户继续使用资源；硬限制则是严格的配额限制，当用户使用的资源超过硬限制时，系统会阻止用户继续使用资源。    3. 存储的可靠性方面，使用RAID监控软件和热备份磁盘，及时备份元数据，以及网络配置等其他方面，以确保Lustre分布式存储在HPC4系统中稳定、高效运行。

  - input: 登录节点的主要功能是什么？用户在登录节点上禁止执行哪些操作？请说明原因。
  - actual output: 登录节点的主要功能是作为用户访问计算资源的入口，提供安全的SSH登录服务，并执行相关的安全策略以确保系统的稳定性和安全性。用户在登录节点上禁止执行的操作包括：1. 禁止使用su命令切换到root用户，原因是防止未经授权的权限提升，降低系统被恶意攻击的风险；2. 禁止更改密码，原因是通过统一的密码规则管理，确保密码结构一致且易于识别，同时避免用户自行修改密码导致的安全隐患；3. 禁止root用户使用密码登录，只能使用密钥登录，原因是增强系统的安全性，防止密码泄露导致的非法访问；4. 禁止无作业的用户通过SSH登录节点，原因是减少不必要的登录行为，降低系统负载和潜在的安全威胁；5. 限制root用户的登录范围，原因是仅允许特定的管理节点使用root账户，避免其他节点被滥用或误操作；6. 对proc文件系统进行限制，原因是保护系统进程信息不被未授权访问，防止敏感数据泄露；7. 禁止用户执行高资源占用的进程，原因是避免因个别用户的高负载操作影响整个系统的性能和稳定性。这些限制措施共同保障了登录节点的安全性、稳定性和高效性。

  - expected output: 登录节点是用户与HPC系统交互的入口，用户可通过SSH登录进行作业提交等操作。当登录节点失去连接或宕机时，可通过堡垒机或监控平台确认状态并重启；若负载过高，可查看并清理高占用进程。在安全策略方面，限制root登录，禁止root ssh密码登录，用户禁止使用su，还对proc进行限制，无作业时禁止用户ssh登录节点等。具体功能和禁止操作如下：    1. 登录节点的主要功能包括为用户提供SSH登录接口，使用户能够进行作业提交、文件管理以及环境配置等操作，同时它也是系统管理的枢纽，承担着作业调度信息展示和系统状态监控的任务。    2. 为了保证系统的稳定性、安全性和高效性，用户在登录节点上有诸多禁止执行的操作：        1). 在系统资源保护方面，禁止运行高计算密集型任务，比如大规模数据处理或复杂模型训练，因为这类任务会大量占用CPU和内存资源，导致登录节点负载过高，影响其他用户的正常登录和作业提交。        2). 在数据安全与存储方面，不允许存储大量业务数据，登录节点的存储空间通常有限，且主要用于临时文件和系统运行所需文件，大量存储业务数据不仅会占用宝贵空间，还可能因节点故障导致数据丢失。        3). 在系统安全运行方面，禁止修改系统配置文件，像/etc/ssh/sshd_config等文件，随意修改可能破坏系统安全策略，例如取消root登录限制会带来安全隐患。同时禁止安装未经授权的软件，未经授权的软件可能携带恶意代码，或者与系统现有软件产生冲突，影响登录节点的稳定性和安全性。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about submitting an MPI job on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, specifically mentioning 'cpus-per-task' and the number of processes. The response provided detailed instructions for running an example program with mpirun or mpiexec using 4 nodes, but did not address how to submit it as a batch job in Slurm. It also didn't mention any specific commands related to submitting jobs on HPC systems like sbatch or qsub, nor did it provide information about the number of processes per node (ppn) and interconnect configuration which are crucial for multi-node setups. The user might be using an older version of Open MPI that doesn't support the 'cpus-per-task' option, so I should have suggested checking the version and providing a fallback method if needed., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output contradicts the retrieved information by stating that the user is using a different method to submit jobs without mentioning the 'yhpc' command line tool mentioned in the claim., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is highly relevant as it directly addresses the user's query about submitting MPI parallel jobs on a high-performance computing cluster, specifically mentioning the use of yhbatch and yhrun commands with options like -n for specifying processes. The other node has no relevance to the topic., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein or his work, only general statements that are irrelevant to the specific query., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 用户需要在cp4分区提交一个MPI并行作业，要求使用112个进程。请写出完整的提交脚本和命令，并解释资源分配逻辑。
  - actual output: 用户需要在cp4分区提交一个MPI并行作业，要求使用112个进程。完整的提交脚本和命令如下：1. 提交脚本示例：编写一个名为sub.sh的脚本文件，内容如下：#!/bin/sh# 提交到cp4分区，使用112个进程yhbatch -p cp4 -n 112 ./aout2. 命令解释：使用yhbatch命令提交作业，-p参数指定分区为cp4，-n参数指定进程数为112，最后指定可执行文件为aout。资源分配逻辑：1. 分区选择：用户指定了cp4分区，系统会根据该分区的资源情况分配计算节点。2. 进程数分配：用户要求使用112个进程，系统会根据可用节点和每个节点的处理器核心数来分配足够的节点数量。3. 资源调度：系统采用抢占式调度方式，即一旦作业开始运行，其他作业无法再分配到同一节点。4. 作业提交：通过yhbatch命令提交作业后，系统会将作业放入队列中等待资源分配，一旦资源满足，作业会在分配的节点上运行。5. 作业执行：作业在分配的节点上运行时，会使用指定的进程数进行并行计算，确保任务高效完成。6. 作业管理：用户可以通过yhcancel命令取消作业，遇到问题可以联系技术支持。7. 注意事项：提交的作业脚本中需确保申请的资源不小于脚本中的需求，避免资源不足导致作业失败。

  - expected output: 在 TH-EX 系统中，MPI 并行作业可通过 yhbatch 批处理方式或 yhrun 交互式方式提交。    1. 批处理作业需编写脚本，脚本以 #! 开头，用 yhbatch 提交时可通过 - n 指定进程数、-p 指定分区等。例如提交到 cp4 分区使用 112 个进程的 MPI 并行作业，批处理脚本可编写为使用# SBATCH -n 112和 # SBATCH -p cp4 等参数。具体脚本如下：    ｜ #!/bin/bash    ｜ #SBATCH -n 112  # 向系统申请 112 个进程。    ｜ #SBATCH -p cp4  # 作业提交到 cp4 分区。    ｜ #SBATCH -J mpi_job  # 设置作业名称为 mpi_job。    ｜ #SBATCH -o slurm_%j.out  # 将作业输出重定向到 slurm_作业 ID.out 文件。    ｜ module load MPI/mpich/4.0.2  #  加载所需的 MPI 模块。    ｜ mpirun -n 112 ./my_mpi_program # 使用 112 个进程运行 MPI 程序。    2. 交互式命令yhrun -N 2 -n 112 -p cp4 ./my_mpi_program提交作业，其中-N 2表示申请 2 个节点，每个节点分配 56 个进程（2×56=112），这种方式适合需要与作业进行交互的场景，但需注意重定向输入输出以避免任务中断。提交后可通过 yhq 查看作业状态，若需取消作业可使用 yhcancel 命令。

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about the storage space issue on /data/diskA, and the assistant provided a detailed explanation of how to check disk usage with df command. However, the response does not address the specific error message 'grace: 6d23h' which seems unusual or unclear in this context. The user might be referring to an error message or some other issue, but it is not mentioned in the assistant's response. Also, the advice given about checking /var/log/df and using df -h does not directly relate to the storage fullness causing system performance issues; they are more general suggestions without addressing the root cause indicated by 'grace: 6d23h'. The user might be experiencing a specific error related to this message, but it's unclear. Therefore, the response is only partially relevant and misses key points about the error itself., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1 because the model's output does not contradict any of the provided contradictions and remains consistent with them., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about exceeding disk quota, which matches the issue described in node with rank 1.

For test case:

  - input: 用户发现存储目录/fs2的磁盘配额已超软限制（512G），系统提示“grace: 6d23h”。请说明此时应采取的措施及监控命令。
  - actual output: 用户发现存储目录/fs2的磁盘配额已超软限制（512G），系统提示“grace: 6d23h”，此时应采取以下措施及监控命令：1. 用户应立即清理不必要的文件以减少存储使用量，确保在倒计时结束前将存储使用量降至512G以下，从而恢复存储状态正常。2. 用户可以使用命令“df -h /fs2”来监控当前存储的使用情况，查看已使用的空间和剩余空间。3. 用户还可以使用命令“du -sh /fs2/*”来查看目录下各个文件或子目录的大小，帮助定位占用空间较大的文件或目录以便进行清理。4. 用户可以通过命令“lfs quota -u username /fs2”查看自己的磁盘配额信息，包括已使用的空间、软限制、硬限制以及剩余的 grace 时间。5. 如果用户需要更详细的配额信息，可以使用命令“lfs quota -g groupname /fs2”来查看组级别的配额情况。6. 用户还应定期检查存储使用情况，避免再次超出软限制，确保数据操作不受影响。7. 如果用户在倒计时结束前未能清理存储，超出软限制且未及时处理，存储将无法写入，数据操作也会受到限制，因此必须尽快采取行动。8. 用户在清理存储时应注意不要删除重要数据，确保数据的安全性和完整性。9. 用户还可以通过系统提供的其他监控工具或命令来跟踪存储使用情况，确保合理使用系统资源。10. 如果用户遇到任何与配额相关的错误提示，如“Some errors happened when getting quotainfo”，应及时联系系统管理员寻求帮助。

  - expected output: TH-eX系统中，用户默认有存储软限制512G、硬限制1T，当使用存储介于512G和1T之间时，系统会提示配额异常并显示倒计时（如“grace: 6d23h”），若倒计时结束前未清理到软限制以下，存储将无法写入；用户可通过jlfs quota -g groupname /fs2或lf quota -u username /fs2查看配额信息，登录时系统也会显示磁盘配额提示。具体可按以下步骤操作：    1. 使用df -h /fs2查看/fs2分区的整体使用情况，确认已用空间和剩余空间。    2. 通过du -sh /fs2/*或du -b /fs2命令以字节为单位统计各目录实际占用大小，定位占用空间较大的文件或目录。找到大文件或无用文件后，对于不再需要的文件，使用rm命令删除；若文件仍需保留，可考虑将其移动到其他有足够空间的存储位置，或进行压缩处理以减少占用空间。在操作过程中，可使用watch -n 5 df -h /fs2实时监控磁盘空间变化，确保清理效果。    3. 清理完成后，再次通过jlfs quota -u username /fs2确认配额使用情况，确保已降至软限制以下。此外，平时应定期使用du -b /fs2检查存储使用情况，避免再次出现配额超限问题。

It only describes general steps for connecting to an SSH server with OpenVPN or WireGuard, which are irrelevant to file transfer post-connection., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1 because there are no contradictions between the retrieval context and the actual output., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about a specific technical procedure for uploading files to a Lustre file system on a Mac, which matches the query exactly. The retrieval contexts provided include one with verdict 'yes' and several with 'no'. However, the positive verdict indicates that there are relevant nodes in the context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about how to connect or configure a VPN on macOS, nor does it provide instructions for uploading files via command line., error: None)

  - actual output: 用户在Mac端成功连接VPN后，可以通过命令行将本地文件data.txt上传到系统的Lustre存储路径/fs2/project，具体步骤如下：1. 确保Lustre文件系统已正确挂载到Mac端的指定目录，例如/fs2/project，这通常需要在系统配置中完成挂载操作并验证挂载状态。2. 使用scp或rsync等命令行工具将本地文件data.txt传输到已挂载的Lustre目录下，例如通过执行scp data.txt user@mount_point:/fs2/project来实现文件上传。3. 验证文件是否成功上传，可以使用ls命令检查目标路径下的文件列表，或者通过读取文件内容确认数据完整性。此外，确保网络连接稳定且防火墙规则允许相关端口通信，以避免传输过程中出现中断或权限问题。

  - expected output: 在Mac端成功连接VPN后，要将本地文件data.txt上传到系统的Lustre存储路径/fs2/project，需借助SSH工具建立连接，再利用SCP或SFTP协议传输文件，具体步骤如下：    1. 确认VPN已成功连接，确保能访问目标系统。    2. 使用SSH命令登录到系统的登录节点，命令格式为ssh 用户名@系统IP地址，登录时可能需要输入密码或密钥认证。登录后，可通过ls /fs2/project查看目标路径是否存在及权限情况。    3. 使用SCP命令上传文件，具体为scp /本地文件路径/data.txt 用户名@系统IP地址:/fs2/project，该命令会将本地data.txt文件复制到目标路径。若需要更交互的方式，可使用SFTP，输入sftp 用户名@系统IP地址，连接后通过put /本地文件路径/data.txt /fs2/project完成上传。    4. 上传完成后，可在登录节点上通过ls -l /fs2/project/data.txt确认文件是否上传成功及文件属性。

For test case:

  - input: 用户加载GROMACS环境时，执行module add gromacs失败，系统提示“模块不存在”。请分析可能原因并提供解决方案。
  - actual output: 用户在加载GROMACS环境时执行module add gromacs失败，系统提示“模块不存在”，可能原因及解决方案如下：1.模块名称或版本错误：用户可能输入了错误的模块名称或版本号，例如模块中没有gromacs/2023-sp-gcc10.4.0-openmpi等具体版本信息，导致系统无法找到对应的模块文件，需要确认模块名称和版本是否正确，并参考系统提供的模块列表进行调整；2.模块未正确安装或配置：如果GROMACS模块未在系统中正确安装或配置，或者模块文件路径未被正确设置，也会导致模块无法加载，此时需要联系系统管理员检查模块安装情况或重新安装GROMACS模块；3.环境变量问题：用户的环境变量可能未正确设置，例如PATH或MODULEPATH未包含模块文件所在的目录，这会导致模块命令无法找到正确的模块定义文件，需要检查并确保环境变量配置正确。

  - expected output: 当用户执行module add gromacs失败并提示“模块不存在”时，可能是由多种原因导致的，需要逐步排查并解决。以下是可能的原因及对应的解决方案：可能的原因分析    1. 模块名称拼写错误：系统中GROMACS模块的实际名称可能与用户输入的“gromacs”不完全一致，例如可能包含版本号、编译器信息或其他后缀，如gromacs/2024.1-sp-gcc11.1.0-ompi5.0.3。    2. 模块未正确安装或未加载模块环境：系统中可能根本没有安装GROMACS模块，或者模块安装路径未被正确添加到模块搜索路径中。    3. 用户权限不足：用户可能没有权限访问模块所在的目录或读取模块配置文件。    4. 模块搜索路径设置问题：模块系统的搜索路径可能没有包含GROMACS模块的存放位置，导致模块系统无法找到该模块。解决方案的具体步骤如下：    1. 检查模块名称：使用module avail命令查看系统中可用的GROMACS模块列表，确认正确的模块名称。例如，在终端中输入module avail gromacs，系统会列出所有与“gromacs”相关的可用模块，用户可根据需要选择合适的模块版本。    2. 确认模块已安装：如果module avail命令中没有列出任何GROMACS模块，可能需要联系系统管理员确认GROMACS是否已安装在系统中。若未安装，需由管理员进行安装。    3. 检查模块搜索路径：用户可以通过module show命令查看模块系统的搜索路径设置，例如输入module show，查看MODULEPATH环境变量是否包含GROMACS模块的存放路径。若路径不正确，可通过修改MODULEPATH环境变量或添加模块配置文件来解决。    4. 尝试使用完整模块名称加载：根据module avail命令列出的正确模块名称，使用module add 模块名称命令加载GROMACS环境。例如，若可用模块为gromacs/2024.1-sp-gcc11.1.0-ompi5.0.3，则输入module add gromacs/2024.1-sp-gcc11.1.0-ompi5.0.3。    5. 检查用户权限：如果确认模块已正确安装且名称正确，但仍无法加载，可能是用户权限问题。可联系系统管理员检查用户对模块目录的访问权限。    6. 通过以上步骤的排查和操作，用户通常可以解决module add gromacs失败的问题，成功加载GROMACS环境。如果问题仍然存在，建议联系系统管理员进一步协助解决。

The assistant provided an answer that does not address the monitoring aspect at all. It only describes how to check free space on multiple disks, but doesn't mention any alerting mechanism or threshold condition (like exceeding 10%) which is crucial for a monitoring script. Also, the response focuses solely on command-line tools and specific commands without addressing the core requirement of sending alerts when usage exceeds 90%. The user might be looking for a more comprehensive solution that includes checking multiple directories and sending email notifications or other actions upon reaching threshold., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 设计一个每日定时检查用户存储配额的脚本，若使用率超过90%则发送邮件告警。请写出脚本核心命令并说明实现逻辑。
  - actual output: 该问题要求设计一个每日定时检查用户存储配额的脚本，若使用率超过90%则发送邮件告警。根据提供的内容，可以利用 `thQuotaUsage` 命令查询用户或用户组的存储使用情况，并结合邮件发送命令实现告警功能。以下是脚本的核心命令和实现逻辑：  \n1. 核心命令包括使用 `thQuotaUsage` 查询用户存储配额，通过 `-u` 参数指定用户名，获取存储使用数据，并解析结果中的使用率。例如 `thQuotaUsage -u <用户名>` 可以查询用户的存储使用情况，输出结果中包含免费配额和付费配额信息。  \n2. 实现逻辑是首先调用 `thQuotaUsage` 命令获取用户存储使用数据，然后计算当前使用率，判断是否超过90%。如果超过，则触发邮件告警。邮件发送可以通过 `mail` 或 `sendmail` 等命令实现，例如 `echo \"配额使用率超过90%\" | mail -s \"配额告警\" user@example.com`。  \n3. 脚本需要设置环境变量 PATH，确保 `thQuotaUsage` 命令可用，例如 `export PATH=/fs2/software/quotaacct/bin:$PATH`。此外，脚本应定期运行，可通过 `cron` 定时任务实现每日检查。

  - expected output: thQuotaUsage命令可用于查询用户或用户组的存储使用情况，通过-u参数查询用户，-g参数查询用户组，-v参数可显示每日详细数据。例如thQuotaUsage -u zhenggang5可查看用户存储使用情况，包括免费配额和付费配额等信息，虽然thQuotaUsageAll命令可统计所有用户和用户组的配额信息，但需先设置PATH路径为/fs2/software/quotaacct/bin:$PATH。要设计一个每日定时检查用户存储配额并在使用率超过90%时发送邮件告警的脚本，可结合系统定时任务和存储查询命令来实现，核心是利用thQuotaUsage获取配额数据并判断使用率，再通过邮件工具发送告警。脚本核心命令及实现逻辑的具体实现如下：    1. 获取存储配额数据：使用thQuotaUsage -u <用户名> -v命令获取用户每日存储使用详情，例如thQuotaUsage -u zhenggang5 -v，该命令会输出用户每天的总存储使用量（Total）和付费存储量（Payment），通过解析这些数据可计算当前使用率。    2. 计算使用率：从命令输出中提取最新日期的总存储使用量（Total）和免费配额（FreeQuota），使用率计算公式为(Total / FreeQuota) * 100。假设Total单位为GB，FreeQuota为1024GB，当Total超过921.6GB（1024*90%）时触发告警。    3. 发送邮件告警：当使用率超过90%时，使用mail命令发送告警邮件，例如echo "存储配额使用率已超过90%，请及时清理！" | mail -s "存储配额告警" user@example.com。    4. 定时执行：将上述命令写入脚本，并通过crontab设置每日定时执行，例如0 0 * * * /path/to/quota_check.sh表示每天0点执行脚本。该脚本通过遍历用户列表，利用thQuotaUsage获取配额数据，计算使用率并在超过阈值时发送邮件告警，结合crontab实现每日定时检查，确保及时发现存储配额超限情况。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user query asks about querying for a specific time period (last seven days) and scope (on communication boards), but the assistant's response does not address either. The answer is too vague and doesn't provide any information on recent or near-term effects, nor does it specify which communication board is being referred to., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is inquiring about the impact time and scope of TH-eX machine operation. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with verdict 'yes' and another with verdict 'no'. However, the question specifically asks for a specific technical detail (impact duration) which might not be covered by both equally. The node with verdict 'yes' likely provides more relevant information as it aligns directly with the user's query about impact time, while the 'no' nodes may contain less direct or general information., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47619047619047616, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything related to querying database records, specifically the query about "查询近七天TH-eX机器通信板过温的影响时间范围"., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user query asks for possible reasons and troubleshooting steps when a specific issue occurs. The assistant's response provided only a brief acknowledgment without providing any actual reasons or solutions, which does not address the core of the question., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user has provided a faithfulness score of 0.80 and mentioned that there are no contradictions in the context, but I cannot verify this without seeing the actual output or response., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user query is asking for possible causes of a specific issue on node TH-3M1 where running dsp programs caused the system to go down. The retrieval context provided includes information about Lustre file system issues, specifically resource exhaustion (ENOSPC) and synchronization problems between MDS and OSTs. These are directly relevant as they address potential causes for system instability when certain operations fail or errors occur in a distributed storage system like Lustre. Therefore, the score is 1 because the retrieved contexts are highly relevant to the user's problem., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4166666666666667, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the specific issue with TH-3M1 or its operation, nor does it address the user's query regarding causes and solutions for system downtime., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: TH-3M1 上，nankai 用户运行 dsp 程序导致系统 MDS（元数据服务器）宕机。给出可能的原因？和排查步骤。
  - actual output: 可能的原因和排查步骤如下：1.可能的原因包括存储分区作业未挂起导致MDS负载过高、Lustre存储故障如OST或MDS宕机、文件系统元数据不一致、磁盘空间不足或端口冲突等。2.排查步骤包括检查运维平台报警信息、查看节点日志和dmesg输出、确认存储分区作业是否挂起、检查OST和MDS状态、验证磁盘空间和端口配置、运行LFSCK修复元数据问题等。3.具体操作包括登录运维平台查看集群总览页面、联系二线值班人员处理SCSI命令错误、重启MDS节点、调整端口配置、扩展OST空间或迁移文件等。

  - expected output: 当TH-3M1上nankai用户运行dsp程序导致系统MDS宕机时，可能是多方面原因造成的，需要系统地进行排查。以下是可能的原因及排查步骤：    1. 可能的原因：        1). 资源消耗过度：dsp程序可能占用了大量的CPU、内存或网络资源，导致MDS资源耗尽而宕机。例如程序存在内存泄漏，不断消耗内存，最终使MDS因内存不足而无法正常工作。        2). 文件操作异常：程序可能进行了大量的高频文件创建、删除或修改操作，产生了过多的元数据请求，超出了MDS的处理能力。比如短时间内创建大量小文件，导致MDS忙于处理元数据更新而崩溃。        3). 程序存在漏洞：dsp程序本身可能存在缺陷，在运行过程中触发了MDS的 bug 或导致系统内核错误，例如程序访问了非法内存地址，引发系统内核 panic，进而影响MDS。        4). 网络通信问题：程序可能产生了大量的网络通信，导致网络拥塞，使MDS无法正常接收和处理请求。比如程序使用了不合理的网络通信模式，发送大量数据包占用带宽。    2. 排查步骤：        1). 查看系统日志：登录MDS节点，查看系统日志文件（如/var/log/messages、/var/log/syslog等），查找宕机前后的异常信息。使用grep命令搜索与dsp程序相关的日志记录，例如grep "dsp" /var/log/messages，查看是否有程序报错或异常行为的记录。        2). 检查资源使用情况：通过监控工具查看MDS宕机前的CPU、内存、磁盘I/O和网络使用情况。可以使用top命令查看CPU和内存占用，iostat查看磁盘I/O情况，iftop查看网络带宽使用情况，分析是否有资源被过度消耗的情况。        3). 分析程序行为：了解nankai用户运行的dsp程序的具体功能和参数，检查程序是否有不合理的配置或参数设置。例如程序是否设置了过高的并发数，导致大量请求同时发送到MDS。        4). 查看节点状态：使用clush命令查看相关节点的dmesg输出，检查是否有硬件故障或驱动问题的提示。例如clush -w mds节点"dmesg | grep -i error"，查看是否有与硬件相关的错误信息。        5). 检查Lustre相关日志：查看Lustre的MDS日志文件（如/var/log/lustre/mds.log），了解MDS宕机前后的操作记录和错误信息，判断是否是Lustre文件系统相关的问题导致宕机。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['系统出现多个故障，包括TH-3F的握手次数变化、TH-HPC的raid1和raid2超时故障。集群总览页面整合了节点、作业和存储信息。运维平台用于处理故障，值班人员可通过登录平台查看报警信息并执行操作。Lustre存储故障处理包括挂起作业、查询日志、重启节点等步骤。', '当命令执行时，可能返回“无法找到文件”错误并永久删除MDS上的文件。无法在文件系统未挂载时直接解析MDS元数据。若OST故障，可使用循环OST或新格式化OST替换。此时丢失的对象会被创建并读取为零。每个OST包含LAST_ID文件，记录MDS预创建的最后一个对象。MDT中的lov_objid表示MDS分配给文件的最后一个对象。LAST_ID应大于lov_objid，否则可能导致对象创建问题。从Lustre 2.5开始，MDS会自动同步LAST_ID和lov_objid。从2.6开始，LFSCK可自动修复LAST_ID文件。若磁盘损坏或恢复，LAST_ID可能不一致，导致错误信息。此时MDS会调整lov_objid以避免删除数据。未被引用的对象将在下次LFSCK时放入lost+found目录。启动Lustre时可能出现“bind: Address already in

For test case:

  - input: 如何将TH-HPC2上cfbc343c 账号的用户根目录改为 THL8 文件系统？给出具体命令。
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，要在 TH-HPC2 上将用户 cfbc343c 的主目录迁移至 THL8 文件系统，需要通过 facl 权限管理以及模块配置来实现，具体操作步骤如下：1. 获取权限和账号信息：用户需要联系支持人员（如郑刚）获取相关权限和账号信息，确保有权限对目标文件系统进行操作。2. 添加 facl 权限：在 TH-HPC2 系统中，由于 facl 数量有限制，可能需要为用户添加新的 facl 权限，以允许访问 THL8 文件系统中的目录。例如，可以使用 `add_user` 命令为用户添加特定软件或目录的权限，命令格式为 `add_user 软件名 用户名 支持专员名字`。3. 配置环境变量：用户需要在自己的 `.bashrc` 文件中添加 `MODULEPATH` 环境变量，以便正确加载模块。例如，执行 `export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/THL8/home/cfbc343c/4c7ffd/modulefiles`。4. 拷贝数据：如果需要将原有主目录的数据迁移到 THL8 文件系统，可以使用 `rsync` 或其他文件拷贝工具进行迁移。例如，使用 `rsync -ltrvP /原路径/ /THL8/目标路径/` 命令进行数据拷贝。5. 测试和验证：迁移完成后，用户应测试新主目录是否正常工作，包括检查文件访问权限、模块加载是否成功等。6. 更新脚本和配置：如果用户之前有运行脚本或配置文件，需要更新这些脚本和配置文件中的路径，确保它们指向新的主目录位置。7. 通知相关人员：完成迁移后，用户应通知相关支持人员或团队，确保他们了解此次变更，并在必要时提供进一步的帮助。以上步骤基于提供的文档内容，具体命令和操作可能需要根据实际情况调整。

  - expected output: 将TH-HPC2上cfbc343c账号的用户根目录改为THL8文件系统，需从系统用户管理和文件系统挂载的角度进行操作。首先需确保THL8文件系统已正确挂载且可访问，若未挂载，需先执行mount /THL8命令挂载文件系统。修改用户根目录时，usermod -d命令会更新系统用户数据库中的根目录信息，但不会自动移动原目录数据，因此需要手动备份和恢复数据。操作完成后，需检查用户的配置文件（如.bashrc、.profile等）是否需要调整，确保用户环境变量和脚本路径正确指向新的根目录。具体步骤如下：    1. 备份原根目录数据：为避免数据丢失，先将原根目录数据备份到临时位置，执行rsync -a /home/cfbc343c /tmp/cfbc343c_backup。    2. 修改用户根目录配置：使用usermod命令修改用户根目录，命令为usermod -d /THL8/home/cfbc343c cfbc343c，此命令会将用户cfbc343c的根目录指向THL8文件系统的指定路径。    3. 创建新根目录并设置权限：在THL8文件系统中创建新的根目录，执行mkdir -p /THL8/home/cfbc343c，然后设置目录权限为用户所有，即chown -R cfbc343c:cfbc343c /THL8/home/cfbc343c。    4. 恢复数据：将备份的数据恢复到新的根目录下，运行rsync -a /tmp/cfbc343c_backup/* /THL8/home/cfbc343c/。    5. 验证根目录修改：登录用户cfbc343c，使用pwd命令查看当前目录是否为/THL8/home/cfbc343c，确认根目录已成功修改。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks about performing stress testing or load testing on a specific set of nodes (the 'thcp4' queue) in an unspecified context, but the assistant's response does not address how to perform such operations. The response is too vague and doesn't provide any actionable steps or explanations for conducting pressure tests on these nodes. It only states that there are many ways to do it without providing details., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates moderate alignment between the model's response and the provided context. The contradictions are minimal but present enough to lower confidence in accuracy., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided do not contain any information specifically mentioning the "thcp4" queue with a capacity of 128GB. The first context has some relevance but is too vague, while the second one explicitly states that it does not mention memory specifications like 128GB RAM., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5238095238095238, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Albert Einstein or related topics., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何对thcp4队列的128GB节点全部执行加压操作？
  - actual output: 根据提供的内容，对THCP4队列的128GB节点全部执行加压操作需要遵循以下步骤和注意事项：1.首先确认需要加压的节点属于TH-HPC4集群中的存储节点，例如THL6、ost12、ost141等，并确保这些节点的状态为running（healthy）状态，可以通过统一监控运维平台查看节点的链接数和运行状态，正常状态应与其他节点一致且处于running（healthy）状态。2.在进行加压操作前，需通过统一监控运维平台或相关命令检查节点的CPU和内存使用情况，确保节点负载不过高，避免因负载过高导致加压操作失败或影响其他作业的正常运行。3.如果需要对多个节点进行批量加压操作，可以利用大屏机房运维总览剧本执行中的批量操作功能，输入节点名称并选择加压操作，系统将自动执行加压任务。4.在执行加压操作过程中，需注意观察节点的资源使用情况，如发现异常应及时处理，例如检查是否有残留进程或节点错误，必要时联系管理员协助处理。5.加压操作完成后，需再次检查节点的状态和资源使用情况，确保加压操作成功且不影响其他服务的正常运行。6.若在加压过程中遇到问题，如节点无法响应或加压失败，可参考文档中提到的故障查询方法，查找导致问题的原因并采取相应措施解决。7.对于128GB节点，需特别关注其内存使用情况，确保加压操作不会超出节点的内存限制，避免因内存不足导致作业被终止。8.在执行加压操作前，建议用户使用yhbatch提交作业，以确保终端关闭或登录节点down机时不会影响加压任务的执行。9.如果加压操作涉及多个节点，需确保所有节点的配置和环境一致，避免因配置差异导致加压操作失败。10.最后，加压操作完成后，需记录操作日志和结果，以便后续跟踪和审计。

  - expected output: 对thcp4队列的128GB节点全部执行加压操作，需借助集群管理工具或运维平台进行批量操作。加压操作前，需确保运维平台具备节点硬件管理权限，且了解节点的硬件规格支持128GB内存配置。若平台不支持直接加压操作，可联系硬件管理员通过BIOS或硬件管理工具进行批量配置。操作过程中需注意避免对正在运行关键业务的节点进行加压，以防影响服务稳定性。具体步骤如下：    1. 确认节点列表：首先需要确定thcp4队列中所有128GB节点的列表。可以通过集群管理命令如yhi -p thcp4查看队列中的节点信息，筛选出内存为128GB的节点，记录节点名称或编号。    2. 登录运维平台：访问统一监控运维平台，找到“节点操作”或“批量操作”功能模块，该模块通常用于对集群节点进行批量管理。    3. 选择加压操作：在节点操作界面中，输入或导入之前确认的thcp4队列128GB节点列表，选择“加压”操作选项。不同平台的操作路径可能有所不同，若平台提供脚本执行功能，可编写加压脚本并指定目标节点。    4. 执行加压操作：确认操作参数无误后，提交执行加压操作。操作过程中，平台会显示进度和状态反馈，可实时监控各节点的加压情况。    5. 验证操作结果：加压操作完成后，通过节点监控工具或命令如yhi -n 节点名查看节点状态，确认内存是否已正确加压至128GB，确保操作成功。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user query is asking for troubleshooting steps for a specific error related to 'TH-3F' and 'stepnodes'. However, the assistant's response does not address these terms at all. It provides general advice about checking network connections and server status but doesn't mention anything about TH-3F or stepnodes. Therefore, it fails to provide any relevant information for the user's specific problem., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provide detailed information on handling node busy errors in HPC environments, including specific adjustments like reducing core count and alternative execution methods. However, the user's query specifically mentions 'TH-3F' which is not directly addressed or mentioned in any of the retrieved documents. The first two nodes are positive but they don't mention TH-3F at all. Therefore, even though the advice given could be applicable if it were about TH-3F, there is no direct evidence provided for that specific system without explicit confirmation.', error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about TH-3F or Requested nodes, so it cannot be relevant to the user query., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: TH-3F 出现Requesteds run :stepnodesare busy报错，如何排查？
  - actual output: TH-3F 出现“Requested nodes are busy”报错，可能由节点资源不足或内存分配不当引起，排查和解决方法如下：1. 调整内存分配：在`yhbatch`中指定总内存分配，例如设置`#SBATCH mem=120GB`，或者在`yhrun`命令中添加`mem=100GB`限制内存使用，避免因内存占用过高导致节点被标记为忙碌。2. 减少核数：如果使用64核作业仍出现被杀情况，建议将核数改为56，减少资源占用，提高作业提交成功率。3. 检查脚本执行方式：确保脚本中没有使用后台执行命令（如`&`），以免导致`yhrun`任务在脚本结束后提前回收节点，影响作业正常运行。4. 查看节点状态：通过`yhcontrol`命令取消不必要的预约，并检查节点的`dmesg`日志，查看是否有异常信息，如网络设备或内存分配问题。5. 优化计算配置：设置`NPAR=4`、`KPAR=1`等参数以优化计算效率，同时尝试使用`mpi-n`编译的`vasp`并用`mpirun`调用，提升资源利用率。6. 确保节点可用性：检查节点列表和分区状态，确认节点是否处于活跃状态，避免因节点维护或故障导致资源不可用。7. 完善脚本逻辑：确保脚本监控所有进程结束再退出，防止任务未完成就被终止。8. 联系系统管理员：若上述方法无效，可联系系统管理员进一步检查集群配置或节点异常情况。

  - expected output: TH-3F系统运行calypso.x和vasp时出现“Requested nodes are busy”报错，可能是节点资源不足或内存分配不当导致。解决方法包括将vasp作业核数从64改为56以减少资源占用，在yhrun命令中添加mem=100GB限制内存使用，尝试使用mpi-n编译的vasp并用mpirun调用，还建议设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1以优化计算效率。以下是详细的排查步骤：    1. 检查节点资源使用情况：使用yhi命令查看thcp4队列中节点的资源占用情况，确认是否有足够的空闲节点。例如执行yhi -p thcp4，查看节点的CPU、内存使用状态，若大部分节点处于繁忙状态，可能是资源不足导致报错。    2. 查看作业队列和等待情况：通过yhq命令查看当前作业队列，确认是否有大量作业等待执行，导致节点被占用。若队列中作业较多，需等待前面的作业完成或联系管理员调整调度策略。    3. 检查作业配置是否合理：查看报错作业的脚本配置，如核数、内存设置是否合理。若作业申请的核数或内存过多，可能导致节点无法满足需求。例如将vasp作业的核数从64改为56，并在yhrun命令中添加mem=100GB限制内存使用，如yhrun -p thcp1 -n 56 exclusive -w $SLURM_NODELIST mem=100GB $EXE。    4. 排查节点故障或异常：使用clush命令检查节点的dmesg日志，查看是否有硬件故障或驱动问题的提示。例如执行clush -w $nodelist "dmesg -T"，若发现如网络设备错误、内存分配失败等信息，需联系管理员处理节点故障。    5. 尝试优化作业参数：调整作业的并行参数，如设置NPAR=4、KPAR=1，优化计算效率，减少资源占用。对于mpi-n编译的vasp，尝试使用mpirun调用，如mpirun -np 64 $exe > log 2>&1。

For test case:

  - input: TH-eX系统计算节点vm.overcommit_memory设置问题导致用户程序报malloc错误，如何修改设置？
  - actual output: 针对TH-eX系统计算节点vm.overcommit_memory设置问题导致用户程序报malloc错误，可以通过以下方式修改设置：1. 调整`/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`参数，将其设置为1，这样可以解决由于虚拟内存地址空间需求超过实际物理内存空间导致的`Cannot allocate memory`错误信息，但需要程序员了解自己的程序不会使用超过物理内存空间大小的内存，否则可能导致其他错误；2. 将多进程程序修改为多线程程序，避免由于非必要内存空间分配导致的`OOM`错误。此外，还可以参考相关资料了解更详细的设置方法和注意事项。

  - expected output: 计算节点多进程程序在内存充足时出现“cannot allocate memory”错误，是因为Linux系统的内存过量分配机制（overcommit）。在使用os.fork()创建子进程时，虽物理内存未满，但虚拟地址空间可能耗尽导致OOM错误。解决方案包括调整/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory参数（默认0，可改为1或2），或改用多线程程序。其中，0是启发式策略，1是无内存过量使用处理，2是拒绝超过swap和物理RAM比例的请求。具体操作如下：    1. 查看当前设置：首先查看系统当前的overcommit_memory设置，执行cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory，默认值通常为0。    2. 临时修改参数：若需临时调整，可执行echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory，将参数改为1，此时内核执行无内存过量使用处理，可增强大量使用内存任务的性能，但需确保程序实际内存使用不超过物理内存。    3. 永久修改参数：如需永久生效，编辑/etc/sysctl.conf文件，添加或修改vm.overcommit_memory = 1，保存后执行sysctl -p使配置生效。若修改为1后仍出现问题，可尝试改为2（需同时设置vm.overcommit_ratio，默认50），即echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory和echo 50 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio，此时系统会拒绝等于或大于总可用swap大小及overcommitratio指定的物理RAM比例的内存请求。修改后需监控程序运行情况，避免因参数设置导致其他内存相关问题。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about debugging a segmentation fault in an HPC environment using Intel MPI and MPICH, which involves specific technical details. The assistant provided a general answer that does not address the issue of signal 9 termination specifically or provide any relevant troubleshooting steps for such errors. Instead, it gives generic advice on checking dependencies, memory usage, and communication issues without addressing the core problem., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query does not contain any contradictions or inconsistencies with the provided context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.0 because the retrieved contexts are all relevant and directly address the specific error related to MKLMPI_Bcast in the context of UCX/UCX issues, even though there might be some discrepancy in capitalization or naming (MKLMPI vs MKL_MPI). The user's query specifically mentions "signal 9" which is a common Unix/Linux signal for segmentation fault. Contexts mention similar errors and solutions involving UCX components, so the score should remain high., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5454545454545454, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not address the user's query about program crashes during molecular dynamics simulations involving UCX and PMIx, instead focusing on unrelated details like Einstein's birth year or photoelectric effect work., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 在使用 Intel MPI 编译的 CP2K 程序进行 AIMD 模拟时，作业频繁因信号 9 终止，堆栈跟踪显示故障发生在MKLMPI_Bcast()调用阶段，且涉及 UCX 库和 PMIx 进程引擎错误。请分析可能的故障原因并给出对应的解决方案。
  - actual output: 该问题可能由多个因素引起，包括库版本不兼容、MPI实现与CP2K的交互问题以及UCX和PMIx进程引擎的错误。解决方案包括更换MPI实现、检查库版本、调整环境变量和进行调试测试，具体如下：1. 库版本不兼容和MPI实现问题：故障可能与Intel MPI和MKL使用的BLACS库存在兼容性问题有关，建议更换为OpenMPI编译以解决兼容性问题；同时，堆栈跟踪中涉及UCX库和PMIx进程引擎错误，可能是由于UCX版本或配置不当导致的问题，需要确保UCX和相关依赖库的版本匹配。2. 内存访问错误和通信阻塞：堆栈跟踪显示在MKLMPI_Bcast()调用阶段卡住，这可能与内存访问错误或MPI广播操作阻塞有关，需检查程序是否存在内存越界访问或数据同步问题。3. 环境配置和调试测试：日志中提到使用mpich/4.0.2-mpi-x-gcc10.2.0环境，性能较HPC系统慢3.28倍，属于正常范围，但部分组合如3m gcc+openmpi和ex gcc+openmpi会出现内存不足或MPI发送错误，建议在ex系统使用debug版本的MPI库进行深入测试，并设置UCX日志级别为WARN以获取更多调试信息。此外，还需检查MPI错误处理程序是否正确配置，避免出现无效参数错误。

  - expected output: 故障发生在MKLMPIBcast()调用，涉及UCX库函数（如ucseventsetwait、uctglexprogress）和PMIx进程引擎（progress_engine），显示MPI广播操作在UCX通信层阻塞。原因是MKL使用的BLACS库与Intel MPI存在兼容性问题，更换为OpenMPI编译后问题解决。在类似问题中，MPIFileset_errhandler调用失败可能与MPI库版本或环境配置冲突有关，但当前问题更聚焦于广播操作中的UCX和PMIx错误。故障原因分析：    1. MPI库与MKL的兼容性问题：Intel MPI与MKL中BLACS库的实现存在冲突，导致广播操作（MKLMPI_Bcast）在UCX通信层阻塞。堆栈中显示的UCX库函数（如uct_glex_progress）和PMIx引擎错误（progress_engine）表明通信框架在处理集体操作时出现异常。    2. UCX库版本或配置问题：UCX库版本与Intel MPI不匹配，或配置参数（如网络传输协议、缓冲区大小）未优化，导致MPI广播操作超时或内存访问错误。    3. 内存访问冲突或溢出：信号9（SIGKILL）通常由内存越界、非法访问或OOM（Out of Memory）引起。MKLMPI_Bcast调用时可能触发了内存错误，如数组越界或缓冲区溢出。    4. PMIx进程引擎故障：PMIx作为进程间通信引擎，若其状态管理或超时机制异常，可能导致集体操作（如广播）无法正常完成，进而触发作业终止。解决方案：    1. 更换为OpenMPI编译CP2K，Intel MPI与MKL的兼容性问题可通过切换至OpenMPI解决。加载OpenMPImodule load openmpi/4.1.4-mpi-x-icc19.0    2. 优化UCX库配置，调整UCX参数以改善通信效率，避免阻塞。调整缓冲区大小export UCX_BUFF_ALLOC_CONF=max_size=1MB,count=1024    3. 检查内存访问与优化代码，排查CP2K代码中可能的内存越界或MKL调用参数错误。使用Valgrind检测内存错误valgrind --tool=memcheck mpirun -n 8 cp2k.popt input.inp    4. 更新PMIx库或调整环境变量，PMIx版本过旧可能导致集体操作超时。若版本过低，更新PMIxyum install pmix-3.2.1-1.x86_64    5. 资源监控与作业调度优化，避免多作业并发导致资源竞争。使用slurm调度作业，设置资源隔离sbatch --nodes=4 --ntasks-per-node=32 --mem=256GB cp2k.job

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is asking for specific steps to check if a task on an 'HPC' (High-Performance Computing) system named HPC3 has encountered an error related to the 'bowen account'. However, note that the term "bowen" might be a typo or miscommunication. Assuming it refers to checking memory usage in an HPC cluster environment, here are some steps to check for memory issues on high-performance computing systems., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because there are no clear contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided include one 'yes' verdict and one 'no' verdict. The 'yes' node is relevant as it directly addresses checking memory usage on HPC systems, which aligns with the user's query about checking if there's an OOM error related to memory issues in a high-performance computing context. The 'no' node is irrelevant because it discusses unrelated errors like MPI and module loading problems. Therefore, the score should be 1 (yes) out of 2 nodes., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5238095238095238, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about the "HPC3系统" (which I assume refers to High-Performance Computing clusters) and its bowen account running tasks or encountering errors., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: HPC3系统的bowen账号运行任务报错，如何检查是否是内存溢出？给出具体步骤。
  - actual output: 检查HPC3系统的bowen账号运行任务是否因内存溢出导致报错，具体步骤如下：1.通过命令yhq查找任务所使用的节点，确认节点信息；2.登录到该节点，使用top或free -g命令查看内存使用情况；3.结合报错信息分析是否为内存不足导致的问题，例如出现“RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: OOM”等提示。

  - expected output: 过往中HPC4 GPU运行deepmd - kit时因计算体系大导致显存不足，报错“RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: OOM”，通过增加显卡数量解决；用户询问查看计算节点内存使用情况时，通过yhq查找任务节点，登录后用top或free -g命令查看。当HPC3系统的bowen账号运行任务报错，检查是否溢出的具体步骤如下：    1. 查看作业基本信息：使用yhq命令查看bowen账号任务的运行状态和所使用的计算节点，确定具体是哪个节点出现问题。这一步能明确后续检查的目标节点，避免盲目操作。    2. 登录计算节点：通过ssh 节点名登录到该计算节点，获取节点的操作权限，以便进行后续的内存检查操作。    3. 使用top命令实时监控：在节点上执行top命令，查看系统的内存使用情况，包括总内存、已用内存、空闲内存等，同时观察各进程对内存的占用情况，特别注意占用内存较高的进程。top命令可以实时展示系统资源的使用状态，帮助发现异常占用内存的进程。    4. 通过free命令查看内存概况：执行free -g命令，以GB为单位查看系统内存的整体使用情况，包括物理内存、交换空间的使用量和剩余量，了解系统内存的总体状况。    5. 检查作业日志和报错信息：查看bowen账号任务的运行日志，查找是否有与内存相关的报错信息，如“OOM”“out of memory”等关键词，从日志中获取更直接的内存溢出证据。作业日志通常会记录运行过程中的异常情况，是判断问题的重要依据。    6. 查看进程内存占用：使用ps -aux | sort -k4nr | head命令，查看占用内存最多的前几个进程，确定是否有进程因内存使用异常导致系统内存溢出。通过排序可以快速定位到内存占用高的进程，便于分析问题来源。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question asks about installing 'nubeam', but I don't have specific information on what this refers to. It could be a misspelling or a less common term, so the answer should clarify that and provide general guidance if possible., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.5 because there is no direct contradiction between the claim and the retrieval context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval result has a verdict of 'yes' which indicates that it is relevant and ranked higher. The other node has a verdict of 'no', meaning it's irrelevant. Therefore, the score should be high because there is one relevant context out of two., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about Albert Einstein's birth year or nationality, despite some statements mentioning Einstein and relativity-related concepts., error: None)

Instead, it provides general information about CMAQ and its components without addressing the installation process., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user has provided a faithfulness score of 0.75 and mentioned that there are no contradictions in the context, but I need to provide a concise reason for this score based on the instructions., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about installing CMAQ v5.4 on HPC systems, which requires specific environmental configurations and modifications to the Makefile based on system architecture. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with a positive verdict (node1) and one with negative verdicts (nodes2-6). However, without knowing what these verdicts refer to or how they are determined, it's impossible to provide a specific reason for each node., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.4583333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about HPC systems or CMAQ installation steps, so it is irrelevant to the user query., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 请说明HPC4系统上安装CMAQ v5.4的步骤，详细说明从加载编译环境到完成CCTM模块编译期间，涉及到的关键软件依赖、环境变量配置和Makefile的修改要点。
  - actual output: 在HPC4系统上安装CMAQ v5.4需要从加载编译环境开始，依次安装必要的软件依赖，配置环境变量，并修改Makefile以完成CCTM模块的编译。具体步骤如下：1. 加载编译环境和设置路径：首先加载Intel编译器和MPI库，例如使用命令“module add Intel_compiler/19.1.2”和“module add MPI/Intel/IMPI/2019.8.254”，并指定软件安装路径为“/fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq”。2. 安装netcdf-c和netcdf-fortran：下载netcdf-c源码并解压后，使用ICC编译器进行配置，设置安装路径为上述指定目录，并禁用不需要的功能如DAP和NetCDF-4。接着安装netcdf-fortran时需指定netcdf的头文件和库路径，确保Fortran接口正确链接。3. 配置ioapi：通过git克隆ioapi-3.2源码，进入目录后修改Makeinclude.Linux2_x86_64ifort文件，将编译器设置为mpiicc、mpiicpc和mpiifort，并调整并行编译选项如OMPFLAGS和OMPLIBS，最后执行make configure、make all和make install完成编译。4. 修改环境变量：在config_cmaq.csh文件中设置IOAPI、NETCDF及MPI的包含目录和库目录，例如“setenv IOAPI_INCL_DIR /fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/ioapi-3.2/ioapi/fixed_src”和“setenv NETCDF_LIB_DIR /fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/netcdf/lib”。5. 编译CCTM模块：运行bldit_project.csh脚本生成编译配置，随后根据需要修改Makefile中的编译器选项和链接参数，确保CCTM模块能够正确调用已安装的依赖库，最终执行编译命令完成CCTM的构建。在整个过程中，需要注意编译器版本与依赖库的兼容性，避免出现如“unrecognized command line option ‘-m64’”等错误，必要时调整编译选项以适应系统环境。

  - expected output: 在HPC4系统上安装CMAQ v5.4，需先加载Intel_compiler/19.1.2和MPI/Intel/IMPI/2019.8.254编译环境，然后安装netcdf-c和netcdf-fortran，其中netcdf-c编译时用CC=icc等参数配置，netcdf-fortran需设置CPPFLAGS和LDFLAGS。接着安装ioapi，修改Makefile和Makeinclude文件，设置BIN等参数并编译。最后配置CMAQ，修改bldit*project.csh和config_cmaq.csh文件，设置环境变量后编译各模块。具体步骤如下：    1. 加载编译环境：执行module add Intel_compiler/19.1.2和module add MPI/Intel/IMPI/2019.8.254，搭建基本编译环境。    2. 安装netcdf-c：下载源码解压，进入目录后执行CC=icc CXX=icc FC=ifort CPP='icpc -E' ./configure prefix=/fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/netcdf disable-dap disable-netcdf-4，再make -j8和make check install。    3. 安装netcdf-fortran：解压源码后进入目录，运行CC=icc CXX=icc FC=ifort CPP='icpc -E' ./configure prefix=/fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/netcdf CPPFLAGS='-I/fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/netcdf/include' LDFLAGS='-L/fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/netcdf/lib'，然后make -j8和make install。    4. 安装ioapi：克隆源码并切换分支，创建目录后执行ln -sf /fs1/home/username/software/wrf-cmaq/netcdf/lib/*.so Linux2_x86_64ifort/，修改Makefile和Makeinclude文件，设置BIN=Linux2_x86_64ifort等参数，最后make configure、make all和make install。    5. 编译CCTM模块：配置CMAQ，修改bldit_project.csh设置CMAQHOME，修改config_cmaq.csh设置各库路径和环境变量，执行后依次编译前处理模块和核心模块CCTM。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about installing OpenFOAM, which requires specific technical steps and instructions. The assistant provided a general explanation of what OpenFOAM is and its applications, but did not address the installation process for 3F (3rd Freedom) specifically or provide step-by-step guidance on how to install it. Therefore, the response is only partially relevant., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 2 because there are no direct contradictions between the retrieved context and the actual output, but some information might be missing or generalized., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 0.8333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval contexts provided include both relevant and irrelevant nodes, but the highest ranked node has a verdict of 'yes' which indicates it is directly addressing the installation process for OpenFOAM on high-performance computing systems. The second node also provides specific instructions related to setting environment variables after installation, which is still relevant as part of the overall installation process. However, there are two nodes with 'no' verdicts that do not provide any useful information about 3F installations or other relevant details.', error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about Albert Einstein or relativity, so it is irrelevant to the question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 请简要描述3F上安装openFOAM的过程是什么？
  - actual output: 在3F系统上安装openFOAM的过程主要包括加载环境模块、设置环境变量、编译安装库和求解器等步骤。1. 加载环境模块，例如在hpc4平台上使用module add openfoam/7-gcc9.3.0-mvapich2命令加载相应的环境模块，确保依赖的编译器和MPI库已正确配置。2. 设置环境变量，如FOAM_USER_LIBBIN和FOAM_USER_APPBIN，用于指定用户自定义库和求解器的安装路径，例如将FOAM_USER_LIBBIN设置为/fs1/home/zhangsl/run/libInflowGen，FOAM_USER_APPBIN设置为/fs1/home/zhangsl/run/scramjetLDReactingFoam。3. 编译安装库和求解器，通过wmake命令分别在指定目录下编译安装库（如libinflowGen.so）和求解器（如scramjetLDReactingFoam），确保编译过程中的依赖项和路径设置正确。此外，在TH3F系统中，也可以通过Spack工具进行安装，但需要处理权限和系统兼容性问题，例如手动修改配置文件或应用补丁。对于其他系统如EX，安装过程可能涉及下载并编译依赖库（如eigen、petsc、precice），配置模块环境，并使用CMake进行编译安装，最后在OpenFOAM中集成插件。整个过程需要注意模块加载、编译器版本及路径设置，以确保安装顺利进行。

  - expected output: 在3F上安装OpenFOAM可通过Spack包管理器或手动编译进行。Spack安装时，加载GCC环境后执行spack install openfoam-org@版本号%gcc@版本号，但可能遇权限或系统兼容性问题，需手动修改配置文件或打补丁，如创建补丁文件修改wmake/rules中的编译参数。手动安装则需下载源码，配置环境变量，如设置MPI_ROOT，然后执行./Allwmake编译，但编译时间较长，可能遇依赖问题需针对性解决。具体安装过程如下：    1. Spack安装方式        1). 加载环境：执行module load GCC/8.3.0（安装2.4.0版本）或module load GCC/9.3.0（安装5.0版本）。        2). 执行安装：            安装2.4.0版本：spack install openfoam-org@2.4.0%gcc@8.3.0^flex@2.6.4^help2man@1.47.11^cmake@3.20.5            安装5.0版本：spack install openfoam-org@5.0%gcc@9.3.0^/gpkfiiv    2. 手动安装方式（以2.4.0版本为例）        1). 下载源码：从官网下载OpenFOAM-2.4.0源码及ThirdParty-2.4.0。        2). 配置环境变量：        ｜ export MPI_ROOT=/thfs1/software/mpich/mpi-x-gcc4.9.3        ｜ export MPI_ARCH_FLAGS="-DMPICH_SKIP_MPICXX"        ｜ export MPI_ARCH_INC="-isystem $MPI_ROOT/include/mpich"        ｜ export MPI_ARCH_LIBS="-L$MPI_ROOT/lib -lmpi"        ｜ export FOAM_INST_DIR=/thfs1/home/用户名/softwarefoamDotFile=$FOAM_INST_DIR/OpenFOAM-2.4.0/etc/bashrc[ -f $foamDotFile ] && . $foamDotFile        ｜ ​export WM_NCOMPPROCS=8        3). 编译：进入源码目录，执行time ./Allwmake 2>&1 | tee Allwmake.log，编译过程可能耗时较长，需耐心等待。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ['本文介绍了在hpc4平台上基于openfoam/7-gcc9.3.0-mvapich2环境安装库和求解器的步骤。首先加载环境模块，然后设置环境变量FOAM_USER_LIBBIN和FOAM_USER_APPBIN指向用户自定义路径。接着在指定目录下使用wmake命令分别编译安装库（如libinflowGen.so）和求解器（如scramjetLDReactingFoam）。整个过程适用于OpenFOAM的扩展开发与定制化应用。',

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not directly address the user's query about the main causes of 'not enough memory' errors in GROMACS simulations. It only mentions a general advice to check system resources and increase swap space, but doesn't specifically analyze or list out the common reasons for this error in GROMACS/GROMACS software like insufficient RAM, virtual memory issues, data size limitations, etc., as expected by the user's query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score reflects a moderate level of faithfulness based on the provided contradictions and their severity., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about analyzing an error message related to memory issues in Gromacs software, specifically the "not enough memory" error. The retrieval contexts provided include two nodes: one with verdict 'yes' and reasons mentioning common causes like input file errors or insufficient RAM, and another with verdict 'no'. However, the user's query does not specify which node is relevant; it asks for analysis of a specific error in Gromacs. Since both nodes are present but only one has positive verdict, I need to determine if either provides more accurate information based on their reasons.

The "not enough memory" errors typically occur when there isn't sufficient RAM or swap space available. The first node suggests checking input file sizes and system resources, while the second node doesn't provide specific advice but confirms it's not a critical issue. Both are somewhat relevant, but the first one gives actionable steps (like reducing trajectory length) which aligns with common troubleshooting for memory issues in molecular dynamics simulations.

The user is likely running a large-scale simulation and needs practical solutions to resolve the error. The second node doesn't offer specific advice, so it's less helpful despite having 'yes' verdict? I'll rank them based on relevance and usefulness: first node has higher score because it provides direct troubleshooting steps for memory issues., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.46153846153846156, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not mention anything about memory management or system errors, and instead focuses on Einstein's scientific achievements which are unrelated to the user query., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 在运行Gromacs处理3亿原子体系时，出现了“not enough memory resources”的UCX错误和"Not enough memory"内存分配失败错误，请分析导致这些问题的主要原因是什么，并指出可能的优化思路？
  - actual output: 运行Gromacs处理3亿原子体系时出现“not enough memory resources”的UCX错误和“Not enough memory”内存分配失败错误，主要原因是系统在尝试创建GLEX区域或进行内存分配时无法满足所需的内存资源，这可能与内存不足、资源分配不合理以及数据传输量过大有关。1. 内存不足是导致错误的直接原因，日志显示在多个时间点多次出现“GLEX create region failed: no enough memory resources”错误，表明系统在尝试分配内存时失败，尤其是在执行能量最小化阶段，程序因无法重新分配内存而崩溃。2. 资源分配不合理可能是另一个关键因素，命令行中使用了768个MPI进程和64个OpenMP线程，这种高并发配置可能导致内存资源被过度消耗，超出系统可用内存的承载能力。3. 数据传输量过大也可能引发内存问题，日志中提到MPI通信错误导致任务被终止，这可能是因为在分布式计算中，每个进程需要传输大量数据，从而增加了内存压力，特别是在处理大规模体系时，数据交换的开销会显著增加。针对上述问题，可能的优化思路包括调整并行配置，减少MPI进程数或OpenMP线程数以降低内存需求；优化内存管理策略，例如调整Gromacs的内存分配参数或使用更高效的算法；此外，还可以考虑增加系统内存或使用更高性能的硬件来支持大规模模拟任务。

  - expected output: 在运行Gromacs处理3亿原子体系时出现“not enough memory resources”的UCX错误和“Not enough memory”内存分配失败错误，主要原因是系统内存资源不足以支撑大规模原子体系的计算需求。从日志可知，程序使用了768个MPI进程，且每个MPI进程搭配64个OpenMP线程，这种资源分配方式可能导致内存过度分配。同时，UCX错误表明在创建GLEX区域时内存不足，进一步印证了内存资源紧张的问题。    主要原因具体如下：        1. 原子体系规模大：3亿原子的体系计算量极大，对内存的需求远超普通体系，容易引发内存不足问题。        2. 资源分配不合理：使用768个MPI进程，每个进程又开启64个OpenMP线程，这种高并发的资源分配方式可能导致内存被过度占用和分配，超出系统实际可用内存。        3. UCX内存管理问题：UCX在创建区域时因内存资源不足而失败，说明系统内存管理机制在处理大规模计算时存在不足。    优化思路具体如下：        1. 优化MPI和OpenMP线程设置：减少MPI进程数量或降低每个进程的OpenMP线程数，例如将OpenMP线程数调整为合理范围（如1 - 6个/进程），避免过度并发导致内存压力。        2. 增加系统内存资源：若条件允许，为计算节点增加物理内存，以满足大规模原子体系的内存需求。        3. 优化计算参数：调整Gromacs的计算参数，如减小非必要的计算精度或调整网格参数，降低内存消耗。        4. 采用分块计算策略：将大规模体系分成若干子块进行计算，减少单次计算对内存的集中需求。        5. 检查内存使用情况：使用内存监控工具（如top、free等）实时监控系统内存使用情况，定位内存消耗的具体来源。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The actual output does not address the user's question about undefined references in code. It only talks about a general explanation of what an undefined reference is, but doesn't provide any specific analysis or solution for the 'undefined reference to symbol' error related to FreeType library., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.5 indicates that there is some discrepancy between the actual output and the retrieved context. The contradictions are: [contradiction1], [contradiction2] etc., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is relevant because it directly addresses the issue of undefined references in CMake projects, specifically mentioning similar errors and solutions involving library linking., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not address the user's query about HPC systems or compilation errors, and instead focuses on Einstein., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 在HPC4系统中，用户编译程序出现"undefined reference to symbol 'FT_Init_FreeType'"等链接错误，导致编译失败。请分析导致这个错误的主要原因，并说明如何正确解决这一类链接问题？
  - actual output: 在HPC4系统中，用户编译程序出现\"undefined reference to symbol 'FT_Init_FreeType'\"等链接错误，导致编译失败的主要原因包括依赖库版本不兼容、缺少必要的库文件以及链接顺序不当。解决这类链接问题需要从以下几个方面入手：1. 该错误通常由freetype库版本过低引起，需升级fontconfig和freetype的版本以满足程序需求，例如通过spack安装指定版本的ncl、freetype和fontconfig来解决依赖问题；2. 在链接命令中添加缺失的库参数，如在-lcairo后添加-lfreetype，确保链接器能够找到所需的符号；3. 检查并正确设置编译器和库路径，加载必要的模块如Intel_compiler、MPI、GCC、blas和lapack，同时在Makefile中合理配置编译选项和库链接顺序，避免因依赖关系未满足而导致的链接失败。此外，还需注意环境变量如PKG_CONFIG_PATH的设置，确保软件安装路径被正确识别。

  - expected output: 在HPC4系统中，用户编译程序时出现“undefined reference to symbol 'FT_Init_FreeType'”等链接错误，这类问题通常是由于链接器找不到相关函数所在的库文件导致的。类似错误如“undefined reference to 'FT_New_Face'”是因为缺少freetype库，解决方法是在链接命令中添加-lfreetype参数；还有因fontconfig依赖的freetype版本过低导致的配置错误，通过更换合适的fontconfig和freetype版本得以解决。此外，其他链接错误可能涉及缺少OpenMP库、BLAS/LAPACK库或链接顺序不当等问题，需通过正确加载模块、设置库路径和调整链接参数来解决。    1. 主要原因分析        1). 缺少Freetype库链接：编译时未正确指定freetype库的链接参数，导致链接器无法找到FT_Init_FreeType等符号的定义。        2). 依赖库版本不兼容：如fontconfig依赖的freetype版本过低，不满足编译要求，导致配置阶段检查失败。        3). 其他依赖库缺失：类似案例中还存在缺少OpenMP库（如libiomp5.so）、BLAS/LAPACK库等情况，导致相关符号未定义。        4). 链接顺序或路径设置错误：链接时库的顺序不当或库路径未正确设置，使链接器无法按预期找到库文件。    2. 解决方法        1). 确认并添加Freetype库链接：            检查是否已安装freetype库，可通过spack find freetype或locate libfreetype.so确认。            在编译命令或Makefile中添加freetype库的链接参数，例如在链接选项中添加-lfreetype。若库安装在非标准路径，需通过-L/path/to/lib指定库路径。        2). 解决依赖版本问题：            若报错涉及依赖版本不满足（如freetype2 >= 21.0.15），使用包管理器（如spack）安装符合要求的版本，例如spack install freetype@2.10.4。            重新配置项目，确保PKG_CONFIG_PATH正确指向新安装的库，例如export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/freetype/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH。        3). 加载必要模块和设置环境：            加载编译所需的模块，如Intel编译器、MPI、BLAS/LAPACK等。例如module add Intel_compiler/19.1.2            检查并设置库路径和头文件路径。例如在 Makefile 中添加LIB=-L/fs1/software/freetype/lib -lfreetype        4). 调整链接顺序和参数：            确保库的链接顺序正确，通常将依赖库放在目标文件之后。例如$(FC) $(OBJ) -o $(PRO) $(LIBF) -lfreetype。             若涉及OpenMP错误（如omp_get_num_threads_未定义），添加OpenMP编译选项，例如FFLAGS+=-qopenmp或-fopenmp。
  - context: None
  - retrieval context: ["编译过程中因fontconfig依赖的freetype版本过低导致错误，通过更换fontconfig和freetype版本解决。后续链接时出现undefined reference to 'FT_New_Face'错误，原因是缺少freetype库，解决方法是在链接命令中添加-lfreetype参数。", 'HPC4系统编译报错问题由songkn用户提出，主要表现为链接错误。解决方法包括加载必要的模块如Intel_compiler、MPI、GCC、blas和lapack。编写Makefile时需正确设置编译器和库路径。报错信息显示缺少符号引用，如`MAIN`、`_gfortran_os_error`、`zheev_`和OpenMP相关函数。最终通过调整Makefile中的编译选项和库链接解决编译问题。', '编译过程中出现多个“undefined reference”错误，主要涉及未定义的符号如`kmpc_reduce@@VERSION`和`WINDWAVE.F90`中的未定义引用。错误信息显示链接器无法找到相关库或符号，可能由于缺少依赖库（如libiomp5.so）或链接顺序不当导致。最终导致`vasp`可执行文件未能生成，编译失败。', "f90\n$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(INC)

The assistant provided a detailed explanation but failed to address how they specifically affect VASP calculations in practice or provide practical advice for optimization., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 0.4 because there are contradictions between the claim and the retrieved context., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is asking about VASP software parameters, specifically KPAR and NCORE. The retrieval contexts provided include one with a verdict of "yes" which discusses the role of NCORE in determining the number of cores per band/k-point for parallelization efficiency, but there is no context or mention of NPAR. However, the user's question does not specify what aspect to compare (e.g., performance vs memory usage), so it might be ambiguous., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context provided does not contain any information about VASP (which I assume refers to the computational software) or its parameters like KPAR, NPAR, NCORE, etc., but instead talks about Albert Einstein and his scientific achievements unrelated to VASP., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 在VASP并行优化中，KPAR、NPAR、NCORE各自代表什么含义？它们之间是如何协同影响VASP整体并行效率的？
  - actual output: KPAR、NPAR、NCORE是VASP并行计算中的关键参数，它们分别代表不同的并行化方式，共同影响计算效率。1. KPAR表示将k点分配给不同的核心组，每个核心组处理一个或多个k点，但不会在k点之间进行数据分布，其设置需为总核心数的整数因子。2. NPAR用于控制带（band）和平面波系数的并行化，它与NCORE共同决定并行方式，且NPAR优先级高于NCORE。3. NCORE表示处理单个轨道的计算核心数，数值越大，每个核心处理的轨道越少，有助于减少通信开销，但会增加内存需求。KPAR、NPAR、NCORE三者相乘应等于总核数以获得最佳性能，单节点情况下，KPAR×NPAR越小，计算速度越快，这表明NCORE越大越有利于提高效率。此外，当单节点核心数能被NCORE整除时，可减少BAND通信，提升效率。NCORE的取值范围较小，适应性更强，通常4适合100原子单元，12-16适合400以上原子。默认参数低效，优化参数可提升并行效率。在大规模并行系统上，建议将NCORE设为每插槽或节点的核心数，以提高性能和稳定性。当使用LMP2LT或LSMP2LT时，KPAR将不再适用。

  - expected output: 1. 各参数的含义    1). KPAR：表示将k点分配给不同核心组的数量。它决定了k点的并行分组方式，默认情况下，一组N=（核心总数/KPAR）个计算核心共同处理一个k点，且数据不会额外在k点上分布。当设置LMP2LT或LSMP2LT时，KPAR将不再起作用。    2). NPAR：用于控制平面波系数的并行分布。它在并行计算中具有较高的优先级，当同时指定NPAR和NCORE时，NPAR的设置会优先被考虑。    3). NCORE：指处理单个轨道的计算核心数，决定了每个轨道由多少个核心共同处理。默认值为1，从VASP.5.2.13版本开始可用，比NPAR更便于使用。2. 协同影响并行效率的方式    1). 三者的关系为NCORE = 核心总数 / (KPAR × NPAR)，它们共同决定了VASP并行计算的核心分配和任务划分方式。    2). 当KPAR×NPAR×NCORE等于总核数时，通常能获得较好的性能。在单节点情况下，KPAR×NPAR越小，意味着NCORE越大，计算速度往往越快。    3). 对于小单元和少量核心的情况，NCORE=1是较优设置，但会增加内存需求和通信开销。而在大规模并行系统和现代多核机器上，建议将NCORE设为2到每插槽或节点的核心数，这样能提高性能并降低内存需求，尤其对于大单元，性能可提升达4倍。    4). 当单节点核心数能被NCORE整除时，可减少BAND通信，在部分多节点计算算例中增加效率。在实际应用中，要根据具体的系统配置和计算任务来优化这三个参数。例如，对于不同原子数的单元，NCORE的最优值不同，100原子左右的单元NCORE约为4，400原子以上的大单元NCORE约为12-16。同时，编译方式也会影响性能，在HPC系统上，Intel+IMPI+MKL的组合性能优于GNU，3F系统中OpenBLAS优于LAPACK/BLAS。总之，需要通过测试来确定最适合特定场景的参数组合，以充分发挥VASP的并行效率。

To achieve high efficiency on massively parallel systems or modern multi-core machines, it is strongly recommended to use all parallelization options available. Most algorithms work with any data distribution (except for the single band conjugated gradient, which is obsolete).\nNCORE is available from VASP.5.2.13 on, and is more handy than the previous parameter [NPAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NPAR).

If NCORE equals the total number of cores, [NPAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NPAR) is set to 1. This implies data distribution over plane wave coefficients only: all cores will work together on every individual band, i.e., the plane wave coefficients of each band are distributed over all cores. This is usually very slow and should be avoided.\nNCORE=1 is the optimal setting for small unit cells, and platforms with a small communication bandwidth. It is also a good choice for up to 8 cores. However, this mode substantially increases the memory requirements, because the non-local projector functions must be stored entirely on each core. In addition, substantial all-to-all communications are required to orthogonalize the bands.\nOn massively parallel systems and modern multi-core machines we strongly recommend to set\nNCORE = 2 up to number-of-cores-per-socket (or number-of-cores-per-node)\nFor large unit cells, we found that this can improve the performance by up to a factor four compared to the default, and it also significantly improves the stability of the code due to reduced memory requirements. Ideally, NCORE should be a factor of the number-of-cores-per-socket (or number-of-cores-per-node), since this reduces communication between the sockets or nodes. The best value NCORE depends']

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's question is about solving a problem related to 'TomoDD' and its computational limits. The assistant provided an explanation regarding the limitations of deep learning models in handling complex problems, which addresses the core issue of computational complexity and resource constraints that could be analogous to TomoDD's potential issues with large-scale computations or specific hardware requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The faithfulness score of 0.67 indicates moderate alignment between the model's response and the provided context. The contradictions are noted in the 'contradictions' list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query is about solving a problem related to TomoDD, which appears to be a typo or misspelling of "TomoDD". However, I am not familiar with this term in the context of technology or programming. It might refer to something specific within a particular domain or perhaps it's a less common acronym. Without more context, it is difficult to determine what exactly they are referring to. The user may have misspelled a word or used an uncommon abbreviation., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5263157894736842, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is not relevant to the user's question because it does not mention anything about TomoDD or its limitations, and instead talks about Einstein and general statements that are unrelated., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 如何解决 TomoDD 提升计算上限引起编译错误？
  - actual output: TomoDD 成像软件在 tomoFDD.inc 头文件中定义了处理量上限，当增大网格等参数时可能出现链接错误，该问题发生在使用 eX 系统默认 GCC/8.5.0 编译器时，错误信息为“relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `contrl`”。解决方法包括在 Makefile 的 Flag 中添加 `-mcmodel=medium` 或 `-mcmodel=large`，或升级至 GCC/11.3.0。修改后的 Makefile 显示两种选项效果相似。1. 在 Makefile 中调整编译器标志，添加 `-mcmodel=medium` 或 `-mcmodel=large` 可以解决链接错误的问题。2. 升级 GCC 编译器版本到 11.3.0 可以避免因编译器优化导致的链接错误。3. 修改后的 Makefile 显示，使用不同的 `-mcmodel` 参数对最终结果影响不大，说明两种方法均可行。
  - expected output: 当 TomoDD 提升计算上限时，可能会因内存模型限制引发编译错误，如使用 eX 系统默认 GCC/8.5.0 编译时出现 “relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol contrl” 错误。对此，可通过修改 Makefile，在编译 Flag 中添加-mcmodel=medium或-mcmodel=large来调整内存模型，也可升级 GCC 至 11.3.0 版本。从修改后的 Makefile 来看，两种内存模型选项效果相近，具体修改需在 CFLAGS 和 LDFLAGS 中分别设置，如CFLAGS = -O3 -I$(INCLDIR) -m64 -mcmodel=medium、LDFLAGS = -O3 -m64 -mcmodel=large。具体解决方法如下：    1. 调整内存模型：在 Makefile 的 CFLAGS 和 LDFLAGS 中添加-mcmodel=medium或-mcmodel=large：        medium模型：允许全局符号地址使用 32 位偏移，适用于大部分场景（数据段≤2GB）。        large模型：完全使用 64 位地址，无偏移限制，但可能增加代码体积。    2. 升级 GCC 版本：切换至 GCC/11.3.0 或更高版本，其默认内存模型策略更优，可减少此类问题。通过模块加载：module load GCC/11.3.0。    3. 检查编译参数兼容性：若同时使用 Fortran 编译，需确保 GCC 与 Gfortran 版本一致，避免因编译器不兼容引发新错误。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for information about using the `nvidia-smi` command and what it can do, but the actual output provided does not directly address how to use the `nvidia-smi` command or its capabilities. Instead, it focuses on general GPU management tasks that are not specific to NVIDIA GPUs, such as checking CPU usage with `top`, memory usage with `free -h`, and system information with `uname -a`. While some of these commands might be related in a broader sense (e.g., monitoring system performance), they are not directly relevant to the question about `nvidia-smi` specifically. The response does not explain how to use `nvidia-smi` or what specific information it provides, such as GPU usage, VRAM usage, driver status, etc., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user's query asks for a concise summary of contradictions between the retrieval context and the provided answer, but there are none listed in the contradiction list., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The user is asking about the usage of the `nvidia-smi` command and what information it provides.

This is highly relevant. The second node with verdict 'no' does not provide any useful information for this query., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.5263157894736842, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the user's query regarding "nvidia-smi" or its usage, and instead focuses on unrelated topics like Einstein's birth year, relativity theory, and other personal details., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: 请告诉我 nvidia-smi 命令怎么用？使用命令后可以获得什么信息？
  - actual output: nvidia-smi 命令用于查看 NVIDIA GPU 的状态和使用情况，通常在需要监控 GPU 资源或排查问题时使用。使用方法包括直接在终端输入 nvidia-smi 或者结合作业调度系统命令如 yhrun jobid=<job_id> nvidia-smi 来查询特定作业的 GPU 使用情况。通过该命令可以获取以下信息：1. GPU 的驱动版本、CUDA 版本以及 GPU 名称等基本信息；2. GPU 的温度、功耗、性能状态以及计算资源使用率；3. 显存使用情况，包括已使用和总显存容量；4. 当前占用 GPU 的进程及其使用的显存大小。此外，还可以看到 GPU 是否处于忙碌状态以及是否有进程在使用 GPU 资源。例如，文本中提到某 GPU 正在使用 98% 的计算资源，占用 1542MiB 显存，而其他 GPU 的使用率为 0%，同时显示有一个 Python 进程占用了 1539MiB 显存。这些信息有助于用户了解 GPU 的运行状态并进行相应的优化调整。
  - expected output: nvidia-smi 是用于查询 NVIDIA GPU 状态的常用命令，在 HPC 系统中，可通过nvidia-smi或结合作业调度命令（如yhrun jobid=<job_id> nvidia-smi）查看 GPU 信息。该命令能显示 GPU 型号、驱动版本、CUDA 版本、温度、功耗、显存使用情况、GPU 利用率等，例如某案例中显示 GPU 0 的利用率为 98%，显存占用 1542MiB，而其他 GPU 利用率为 0%，还能列出占用 GPU 的进程及显存使用量，如 Python 进程占用 1539MiB 显存。具体如下：    1. 基本用法        1). 直接查询本地 GPU：在计算节点直接执行nvidia-smi，实时获取当前节点所有 GPU 状态。        2). 查询作业关联 GPU：通过yhrun jobid=<job_id> nvidia-smi查询指定作业所在节点的 GPU 使用情况（适用于 k80 等集群）。        3). 定时刷新查询：添加-l <秒数>参数定时刷新，如nvidia-smi -l 5每 5 秒更新一次。    2. 输出信息        1). 头部信息：显示 NVIDIA-SMI 版本、驱动版本、CUDA 版本。        2). GPU 状态：            基础信息：GPU 编号、名称、持续模式（Persistence-M）、总线 ID（Bus-Id）、是否用于显示（Disp.A）。            运行状态：风扇转速（Fan）、温度（Temp）、性能状态（Perf）、功耗（Pwr:Usage/Cap）。            内存使用：显存总量 / 已用 / 剩余（Memory-Usage）、GPU 利用率（GPU-Util）、计算模式（Compute M.）。        3). 进程信息：列出占用 GPU 的进程 PID、类型（如 C 表示计算进程）、进程名称及显存占用量。

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The answer provided does not directly address how to solve the specific VASP error 'internal error in setup of charge density' related to the maximum number of atoms. It instead discusses a different issue about customer service, which is unrelated to the user's query., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is lower because there's a contradiction between the user's claim and the retrieved information., error: None)
  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The score is 1.0 because all retrieval contexts are relevant and directly address the user's query about resolving an internal error in VASP related to NB_TOT exceeding NMAX_DEG by providing specific solutions like increasing parameters or recompiling with changes, even though one context mentions a different error (NB_TOT vs NMAX_DEG) but still provides instructions that could be relevant if similar issues exist. However, the user's query specifically asks about 'internal error in SETUP_DEG_CLUSTERS: NB_TOT exceeds NMAX_DEG' and the contexts do not directly address this exact issue or provide specific solutions for it., error: None)
  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.47368421052631576, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: deepseek-r1:latest (Ollama), reason: The retrieval context is highly relevant to the user query because it directly addresses VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) error messages, specifically mentioning "internal error" and providing specific steps to resolve issues related to parameter limits., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: VASP运行报错 internal error in SETUP_DEG_CLUSTERS: NB_TOT exceeds NMAX_DEG 如何解决？
  - actual output: 针对VASP运行报错“internal error in SETUP_DEG_CLUSTERS: NB_TOT exceeds NMAX_DEG”的解决方法，可以按照以下步骤进行操作：1. 修改源码中的NMAX_DEG参数以适应计算需求，具体是将NMAX_DEG的值从默认的48增加到82或更高，这可以通过使用sed命令在subrot_cluster.F文件中进行修改实现；2. 在修改完源码后需要重新编译VASP程序，这包括加载必要的编译器和库环境，如Intel编译器、MPI、MKL和FFTW等，并根据当前环境调整makefile.include配置文件，确保编译过程顺利进行；3. 完成上述步骤后，执行make命令进行编译，生成新的可执行文件，从而解决该报错问题。此外，确保在编译过程中遵循正确的环境配置和依赖项设置，避免因环境不兼容导致的其他错误。

  - expected output: 当 VASP 运行出现 “internal error in SETUP_DEG_CLUSTERS: NB_TOT exceeds NMAX_DEG” 报错时，说明计算中所需的原子簇数量（NB_TOT）超过了源码中预设的最大限制（NMAX_DEG）。解决此问题需修改源码中的 NMAX_DEG 参数并重新编译，具体步骤如下：用 sed 命令将 subrot_cluster.F 文件中的 NMAX_DEG 值从 48 改为 480，复制并修改 makefile.include，添加 OpenMP 和 MKL 相关参数，最后执行 make 编译。    1. 环境准备与源码解压：先加载 Intel 编译器、MPI 和 MKL 等环境，解压 VASP 源码，    ｜ module purge    ｜ ​module load Intel_compiler/19.0.4    ｜ ​module load MPI/openmpi/4.1.2-mpi-x-icc19.0    ｜ ​module load MKL/19.1.2    ｜ ​pv vasp.5.4.4.tar.gz | tar xzf -    ｜ ​cd vasp.5.4.4    2. 修改源码参数：使用 sed 命令修改 subrot_cluster.F 中的 NMAX_DEG，根据报错提示将其设为足够大的值（如 82 或 480）：sed -i "s/NMAX_DEG=48/NMAX_DEG=480/" src/subrot_cluster.F    3. 配置编译文件：复制并调整 makefile.include，适配编译器和库路径：    ｜ cp arch/makefile.include.linux_intel makefile.include    ｜ ​sed -i "s/mpiifort/mpifort/" makefile.include          # 适配Fortran编译器    ｜ ​sed -i "s/-mkl=sequential/-qopenmp -mkl=sequential/" makefile.include  # 启用OpenMP    ｜ ​sed -i "s/-lmkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64/-lmkl_blacs_openmpi_lp64 -lmkl_gf_ilp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_gnu_thread/" makefile.include  # 修正MKL链接参数    4. 重新编译：make
